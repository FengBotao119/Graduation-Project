277,977.508,982.827,Ellie,feelbadly (tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself)
278,981.7,982.03,Participant,mm
279,984.66,985.11,Participant,hmm
280,992.28,995.09,Participant,so at the last organization i used to work at
281,995.875,998.155,Participant,i had a boss and she was
282,998.74,1000.86,Participant,i don't feel like she was um
283,1003.36,1007.55,Participant,i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh
284,1008.605,1010.655,Participant,used to push my buttons or so i thought
285,1011.48,1013.24,Participant,and so um
286,1015.11,1021.26,Participant,one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer
287,1021.82,1025.09,Participant,um and he was upset about something and
288,1025.55,1032.61,Participant,it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was
289,1033.14,1033.56,Participant,um
290,1034.53,1038.99,Participant,but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i
291,1039.5,1042.6,Participant,have very strong opinions about how you handle
292,1043.33,1046.01,Participant,challenges with people <peo> with staff members
293,1046.108,1046.638,Ellie,yeah2 (yeah)
294,1046.57,1050.45,Participant,and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought
295,1050.92,1054.88,Participant,um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel
296,1055.74,1059.71,Participant,um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it
297,1060.24,1061.36,Participant,and um
298,1062.45,1063.39,Participant,i did you know
299,1063.79,1065.32,Participant,i tried to be very calm and
300,1066.16,1069.37,Participant,said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but
301,1070.38,1075.1,Participant,uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there
302,1075.59,1082.45,Participant,to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me
303,1082.83,1084.51,Participant,or after we had that interaction so
304,1082.985,1083.425,Ellie,yeah_downer (yeah)

306,1087.786,1090.736,Ellie,advice_back (what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago)
307,1091.96,1093.38,Participant,<laughter>
308,1094.48,1098.0,Participant,so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this
309,1098.79,1102.45,Participant,thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had
310,1103.08,1104.14,Participant,read it back then
311,1104.85,1105.59,Participant,which is
312,1106.11,1109.09,Participant,um when you think about buying something instead of thinking
313,1109.79,1110.77,Participant,uh oh
314,1111.37,1115.06,Participant,here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it
315,1115.89,1119.35,Participant,it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that
316,1119.75,1125.49,Participant,because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it
317,1126.12,1126.4,Participant,you know
318,1126.93,1130.83,Participant,intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so
319,1131.24,1137.77,Participant,you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh
320,1138.64,1140.7,Participant,been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago
321,1141.309,1142.039,Ellie,hmmB (hmm)

324,1151.22,1156.65,Participant,scrubbed_entry

326,1162.545,1172.705,Participant,and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them
327,1173.27,1173.6,Participant,so
328,1176.0430000000001,1176.503,Ellie,okay_confirm (okay)
