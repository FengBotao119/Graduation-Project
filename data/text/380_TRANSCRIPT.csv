208,886.471,894.25,Participant,which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they
209,894.66,896.43,Participant,how they interact in the plot
210,896.79,897.551,Participant,um
211,898.04,899.0210000000001,Participant,kind of like
212,899.99,900.7510000000001,Participant,uh
213,903.0,904.1,Participant,yeah i guess
214,904.75,911.54,Participant,i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's
215,912.05,913.081,Participant,the um
216,913.89,918.46,Participant,i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i
217,918.971,926.78,Participant,i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like
218,922.9789999999999,923.449,Ellie,mm (mm)
219,927.43,930.15,Participant,in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it
220,930.571,939.89,Participant,um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool
221,940.29,940.821,Participant,um
222,941.36,945.46,Participant,the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but
223,945.98,954.55,Participant,but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained
224,954.664,955.194,Ellie,yeah2 (yeah)
225,954.82,957.22,Participant,and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie
226,957.65,961.6,Participant,and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like
227,962.03,964.071,Participant,so in the movie django unchained
228,964.44,972.3710000000001,Participant,um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big
229,972.9910000000001,973.1310000000001,Participant,the
230,973.64,975.25,Participant,big purpose of the movie is
231,975.403,975.793,Ellie,right2 (right)
232,975.73,976.4810000000001,Participant,and um
233,977.28,979.49,Participant,and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh
234,979.93,985.46,Participant,who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he
235,986.04,993.64,Participant,was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django
236,994.01,1003.65,Participant,or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera
237,1004.15,1004.8710000000001,Participant,and um
238,1005.44,1018.1510000000001,Participant,and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not
239,1018.6510000000001,1021.48,Participant,sacrifice themself for someone else
240,1021.539,1022.2689999999999,Ellie,hmmB (hmm)
241,1022.06,1025.52,Participant,um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like
242,1026.021,1026.5410000000002,Participant,um
243,1028.28,1029.01,Participant,like who
244,1029.42,1031.64,Participant,uh like
245,1032.48,1034.57,Participant,she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that
246,1035.07,1040.51,Participant,altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist
247,1040.83,1047.56,Participant,um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself
248,1047.941,1055.18,Participant,um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like
249,1055.651,1068.0410000000002,Participant,every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor
250,1068.3110000000001,1068.781,Ellie,yeah3 (yeah)
251,1068.45,1075.27,Participant,in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um
252,1076.92,1083.8,Participant,purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate
253,1084.14,1084.941,Participant,um
254,1085.37,1086.271,Participant,and uh
255,1087.111,1089.631,Participant,somewhat like yeah and it's it uh
256,1090.761,1099.0,Participant,so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um
257,1099.38,1101.63,Participant,i think of losing my temper as being more
258,1103.8,1104.441,Participant,um
