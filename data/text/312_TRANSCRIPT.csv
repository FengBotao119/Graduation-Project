31,141.31,147.23,Participant,uh that's a good question you're actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly
32,149.27,150.31,Ellie,are you still working in that
33,151.31,152.48,Participant,yes i am actually
34,154.45,155.14,Ellie,what do you do now
35,156.24,165.52,Participant,right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and i'm going back to grad school hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire
36,167.12,167.61,Ellie,awesome
37,168.6,169.04,Participant,impressive
38,169.01,170.03,Ellie,what's your dream job
39,171.79,174.95,Participant,professor at a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or like that
40,175.87,179.29,Participant,where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest
41,180.36,181.0,Ellie,<laughter>
42,182.43,183.83,Participant,you're actually pretty good at this
43,185.5,187.69,Ellie,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
44,190.19,192.11,Participant,<sigh> i there's a lot of people
45,192.68,202.2,Participant,the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know
46,203.19,204.49,Participant,he's the first one who taught me that
47,205.83,208.49,Participant,school was not about a grade but about learning

108,411.59,415.39,Participant,i'm not really sure if you can't not saying you can't get better than me in math but thing is
109,416.17,422.4,Participant,it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think
110,422.97,431.42,Participant,and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway

115,447.58,448.07,Participant,um
116,448.64,456.2,Participant,what's really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood
117,458.16,458.84,Ellie,nice
118,459.69,460.08,Participant,thank you

128,490.37,497.08,Participant,you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics
129,497.78,498.27,Participant,and
130,498.85,502.37,Participant,you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it
131,502.95,506.62,Participant,and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you
132,507.37,519.27,Participant,as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid
133,523.23,523.58,Ellie,yeah
134,525.83,526.18,Participant,okay
