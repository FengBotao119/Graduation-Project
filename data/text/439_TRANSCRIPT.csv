97,445.245,452.475,Participant,for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls
98,452.88,458.64,Participant,so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel
99,459.2,468.56,Participant,and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they

104,496.61,501.21,Participant,i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly

107,505.597,507.657,Ellie,control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
108,508.67,510.31,Participant,i think before i speak

110,515.43,519.18,Participant,i take on other people's feelings before i um
111,519.99,522.11,Participant,blurt out the wrong thing i try to
112,522.65,525.23,Participant,uh analyze the situation first
113,525.73,533.2,Participant,before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of
114,533.596,534.126,Ellie,yeah2 (yeah)
115,536.451,539.501,Ellie,last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
116,540.64,541.41,Participant,um
117,544.195,554.905,Participant,<laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house
118,556.39,559.09,Participant,uh we had a disagreement on that um
119,559.6,562.54,Participant,men have their own way of doing things and um
120,563.03,566.4,Participant,i had told him not to use a certain uh
121,567.08,569.28,Participant,eh person to work on our house
122,569.88,574.55,Participant,but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead
123,574.95,577.18,Participant,and now he sees all the downfalls
124,577.54,581.31,Participant,and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so
125,581.66,584.32,Participant,but i guess he can tell by my facial expression
126,584.93,590.87,Participant,that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money
127,591.35,598.49,Participant,and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong
128,599.09,609.02,Participant,and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project
129,609.855,614.805,Participant,so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um
130,615.35,616.99,Participant,that i can think of that's recent
131,617.637,619.177,Ellie,describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
132,620.31,625.11,Participant,i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me
133,625.49,635.84,Participant,and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um
134,636.83,638.41,Participant,you need to do your research
135,638.73,646.33,Participant,i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's
136,646.685,653.18,Participant,but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money
137,653.735,657.895,Participant,and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed
138,658.39,663.19,Participant,he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>
139,660.6560000000001,661.046,Ellie,right2 (right)
140,663.64,669.66,Participant,which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money
141,670.19,674.66,Participant,and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because
142,671.054,671.8939999999999,Ellie,that_sucks (that sucks)
143,675.15,680.7,Participant,it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again
144,681.595,682.035,Ellie,yeah_downer (yeah)
145,681.735,683.255,Participant,and it didn't make any sense
146,685.315,689.0939999999999,Ellie,situation_handled (tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently)
147,690.63,691.2,Participant,um
148,694.29,695.37,Participant,i retired early
149,696.34,704.47,Participant,um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california
150,705.28,713.46,Participant,um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen
151,714.12,716.83,Participant,and i had like thirty one and a half years of service
152,717.39,723.37,Participant,and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance
153,723.79,731.28,Participant,so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but
154,731.81,737.27,Participant,um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long
155,738.14,738.74,Participant,um
156,739.19,746.45,Participant,i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay
157,746.99,752.62,Participant,um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job
158,753.04,758.54,Participant,because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um
159,759.595,770.865,Participant,i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up
160,771.5,773.7,Participant,and i don't i pay very little money
161,774.04,780.45,Participant,so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive
162,780.9910000000001,781.461,Ellie,yeah3 (yeah)
163,783.1389999999999,786.7389999999999,Ellie,hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)
164,787.74,788.66,Participant,um
165,789.15,790.2,Participant,let me see the hardest
166,791.815,796.355,Participant,it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying
167,797.005,798.635,Participant,and my mother um
168,799.23,802.83,Participant,died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma
169,803.39,804.13,Participant,and
170,805.2,812.19,Participant,i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying
171,812.565,817.385,Participant,or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me
172,817.95,820.51,Participant,and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx
173,821.15,829.85,Participant,and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order
174,830.42,837.52,Participant,and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things
175,837.95,845.21,Participant,you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and
176,845.75,851.345,Participant,i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff
177,851.87,855.28,Participant,and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting
178,855.84,864.34,Participant,she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had
179,864.705,870.505,Participant,a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything
180,871.383,872.7330000000001,Ellie,been_hard (that sounds really hard)
181,872.5,874.47,Participant,yeah it was it was but
182,875.61,880.9,Participant,and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um
183,881.5,886.86,Participant,since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children
184,887.45,889.36,Participant,that my husband and i we got together
185,889.77,895.42,Participant,and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um
