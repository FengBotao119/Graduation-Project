69,298.57,308.94,Participant,mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice what you really wanna do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a ninety eight percent chance of failure
70,309.26,317.98,Participant,even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time

117,524.52,528.68,Participant,i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that
118,529.34,538.96,Participant,if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed and to be able to talk to them
119,539.3009999999999,539.831,Ellie,yeah2 (yeah)
120,539.39,541.65,Participant,and i and he said that are you aware that
121,542.53,543.36,Participant,um
122,543.67,547.19,Participant,<tisk> about something in your past and i go yes i believe that
123,547.61,553.54,Participant,many religions uh including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have <ha> have
124,554.44,560.42,Participant,had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness
125,560.94,564.91,Participant,um resulting from even your past relationships or your
126,565.24,574.02,Participant,parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe i said that
127,574.88,582.42,Participant,you know that you have the power of each person has a god like or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself
128,582.9,586.31,Participant,even when i'm on the verge of possibly being i probably get one cold
129,586.87,590.76,Participant,maybe every fifteen years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all
130,591.1,593.98,Participant,and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on the verge
131,594.46,595.17,Participant,i take
132,595.71,599.53,Participant,sort of like and i did this even when i was a child uh when i was seven i would

136,607.513,607.903,Ellie,right2 (right)
137,610.66,612.4,Participant,and i would actually
138,612.96,618.16,Participant,even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back
139,618.51,621.78,Participant,i concentrated healing and and when i went back to the hospital
140,622.44,626.56,Participant,the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that
141,626.93,634.67,Participant,just <jj> her last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but uh
142,635.48,636.08,Participant,um
143,637.48,642.68,Participant,uh but i was just i think annoyed and irritated a little because the scientologist told me that
144,643.68,650.88,Participant,because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and
145,651.29,654.83,Participant,it didn't <did> it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was
146,655.63,661.85,Participant,um whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i'd been practicing buddhism whether it was for five ten fifteen
147,662.34,671.1,Participant,twenty years or whether somebody'd been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and bending sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean this person could have
148,671.44,675.37,Participant,never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has
149,675.8889999999999,676.419,Ellie,yeah2 (yeah)
150,676.0,676.4,Participant,you know
151,676.82,680.51,Participant,so i just was thinking that was the antithesis of
152,681.37,685.45,Participant,somebody who says they're enlightened but it's just the way i guess he kept cramming his
153,686.96,687.48,Participant,uh
154,687.89,694.58,Participant,you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with him but he it was so pompous that i became irritated
155,695.132,695.602,Ellie,yeah3 (yeah)
156,696.19,701.69,Participant,especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery
157,696.492,697.442,Ellie,understand (i understand)
158,702.57,703.9,Participant,uh the following week
159,704.22,706.97,Participant,and i didn't point it out to him 'cause i just didn't wanna get
160,707.47,708.19,Participant,into it but
161,708.73,720.05,Participant,one could say hey you have a bad hip 'cause you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get a hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused
162,720.3,721.65,Participant,by people themselves
163,722.21,726.98,Participant,and then he's flippantly said well are you aware of scientologists believe that
164,727.88,729.97,Participant,past lives can also affect
165,730.64,735.1,Participant,you know and i'm thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are
166,736.32,743.59,Participant,are kind of like well known for you know believing in in a cause and effect and past lives situations and i found my thought
167,744.15,748.2,Participant,he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people <laughter> from other religions so
168,748.64,749.74,Participant,but um
169,750.39,753.1,Participant,<tisk> you know i i you know i i just didn't
170,753.47,756.17,Participant,you know care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter>
171,755.987,756.457,Ellie,yeah3 (yeah)
172,757.79,759.14,Participant,but other than that i mean i don't
