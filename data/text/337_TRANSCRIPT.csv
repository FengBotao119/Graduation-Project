80,324.42,325.9,Ellie,what do you enjoy about traveling
81,327.27,336.58,Participant,seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change 
82,337.33,342.97,Participant,i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of 
83,344.05,347.58,Participant,where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that
84,348.85,349.16,Ellie,uh huh
85,349.08,351.64,Participant,but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter>
86,352.34,353.03,Ellie,<laughter>
87,353.08,353.87,Participant,<laughter> <clears throat>
88,354.46,356.03,Ellie,i'd love to hear about one of your trips
89,357.94,358.91,Participant,um
90,359.77,360.22,Participant,let's see
91,361.19,369.65,Participant,xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line
92,371.18,374.2,Participant,um my cousin and i would take what we call
93,375.12,383.43,Participant,exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just  
94,384.38,388.19,Participant,sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off
95,388.81,395.14,Participant,so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight
96,395.99,398.21,Participant,just small short trips that
97,399.36,403.31,Participant,aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how
98,403.95,412.37,Participant,um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas 
99,411.71,412.01,Ellie,uh huh
100,413.16,414.65,Participant,so close to home but not
101,415.95,424.35,Participant,but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that
102,425.14,434.98,Participant,kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway
103,435.48,435.86,Ellie,yeah
104,435.9,438.6,Participant,so i i like i like doing that
105,436.23,437.22,Ellie,i see what you mean
106,439.84,440.11,Ellie,cool
107,440.91,442.46,Ellie,when was the last time that happened
108,443.94,449.91,Participant,the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that
109,450.64,455.45,Participant,we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am
110,456.33,463.3,Participant,and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live
111,463.95,467.21,Participant,so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas
112,467.93,474.1,Participant,and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda
113,474.9,477.94,Participant,i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there
114,478.64,479.7,Participant,and we came back and was
115,480.47,480.89,Participant,you know
116,481.56,485.59,Participant,an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so
117,485.37,485.75,Ellie,wow
118,487.95,489.25,Participant,it was kind of an interesting
119,488.57,490.68,Ellie,what are some things that make you really mad
120,492.88,503.14,Participant,uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back  
121,504.25,504.9,Participant,and
122,506.14,506.85,Participant,i actually
123,508.24,509.71,Participant,like to see people who are
124,511.41,517.75,Participant,strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate
125,518.36,518.7,Ellie,yeah
126,518.6,519.23,Participant,or what have you
127,520.58,524.79,Participant,so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason
128,525.53,529.95,Participant,you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it
129,531.07,533.05,Participant,just that kinda really just makes me mad
130,531.52,531.82,Ellie,uh huh
131,534.72,535.15,Ellie,okay
132,535.69,537.15,Ellie,what do you do when you're annoyed
133,538.97,548.77,Participant,when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either  
134,549.89,551.08,Participant,you know verbally just
135,553.08,554.56,Participant,cutting 'em with a quip or
136,555.05,555.57,Participant,you know
137,556.08,559.01,Participant,i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody
138,560.24,562.79,Participant,but i'll try to you know
139,563.66,571.44,Participant,if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works 
140,570.16,571.67,Ellie,has that gotten you in trouble
141,572.89,577.42,Participant,not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to
142,578.25,579.73,Participant,get them to leave me alone
143,580.97,581.45,Participant,um
144,586.16,594.63,Participant,so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction
145,595.09,604.01,Participant,and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if 
146,595.34,595.69,Ellie,uh huh
147,604.98,607.26,Participant,it's is trouble it's usually trouble that
148,608.03,614.89,Participant,it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of 
149,615.95,619.86,Participant,so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it
150,620.5,621.0,Ellie,okay
151,622.31,625.28,Ellie,when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
152,626.71,629.18,Participant,uh the last time i argued with somebody
153,630.99,631.21,Participant,like
154,632.4,637.41,Participant,person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my
155,636.72,637.8,Ellie,whatever comes to your mind
156,639.07,641.64,Participant,uh the last thing i can think of was
157,643.23,643.76,Participant,i
158,644.43,649.33,Participant,argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia
159,650.11,657.47,Participant,and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a
160,658.07,663.78,Participant,i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature
161,664.55,670.92,Participant,but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her 
162,667.67,668.04,Ellie,yeah
163,672.08,677.0,Participant,and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us
164,677.55,689.47,Participant,because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process 
165,690.09,690.41,Ellie,yeah
166,690.45,697.4,Participant,but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like
167,697.9,705.24,Participant,i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that
168,706.24,706.43,Participant,it
169,707.25,707.91,Participant,brings you
170,708.73,718.79,Participant,a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened
171,719.32,723.61,Participant,when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it 
172,724.06,729.04,Participant,and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it
173,730.13,733.97,Participant,but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her
174,734.55,742.79,Participant,yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually
175,743.42,743.82,Ellie,yeah
176,743.42,751.05,Participant,and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care
177,751.83,757.08,Participant,but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad
178,757.79,761.23,Participant,but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore
179,761.85,770.48,Participant,so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do
180,771.19,781.18,Participant,i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that
181,774.89,775.22,Ellie,uh huh
182,782.48,785.26,Participant,so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's
183,786.68,788.95,Participant,a dual effort it's very much a dual effort
184,789.81,793.2,Participant,but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like
185,795.31,798.77,Participant,a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but
186,799.78,801.26,Participant,lively discussion <laughter>
187,801.72,803.05,Participant,you know than debate
188,802.06,802.48,Ellie,i see
189,804.62,805.99,Ellie,that sounds really hard
190,807.28,807.64,Participant,meh
191,808.98,812.76,Participant,it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever
192,813.56,817.49,Participant,and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you
193,818.06,821.34,Participant,so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy
194,822.06,824.69,Participant,but you deal with it and you you move on
195,825.7,826.08,Ellie,yeah
196,827.64,829.96,Ellie,who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
197,831.04,834.66,Participant,uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother
198,835.27,840.47,Participant,'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually
199,843.12,845.4,Participant,gave me a lot of confidence
200,846.13,848.56,Participant,and but were realistic about it
201,849.76,852.03,Participant,so i mean i think i have sort of a
202,853.08,862.89,Participant,realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over
203,863.67,863.99,Ellie,uh huh
204,863.74,871.37,Participant,and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life
205,872.01,877.4,Participant,and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed  
206,878.96,879.74,Ellie,that's great
207,882.36,883.38,Ellie,is there anything you regret
208,886.04,892.7,Participant,i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions
209,893.56,903.46,Participant,now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home
210,904.14,905.71,Participant,my focus was to get her home
211,904.7,905.06,Ellie,yeah
212,906.66,916.48,Participant,so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year
213,916.95,920.19,Participant,eating just horrible foods when i did eat
214,920.94,923.94,Participant,so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick 
215,924.67,926.83,Participant,and i'm wondering well if i didn't
216,927.4,934.78,Participant,if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded
217,935.96,939.64,Participant,would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em
218,940.4,944.07,Participant,and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she 
219,944.97,952.71,Participant,uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and
220,953.62,955.54,Participant,her health insurance provider missed that
221,956.34,957.57,Participant,so she wound up having
222,956.6,957.02,Ellie,wow
223,958.52,959.59,Participant,sort of this whole
224,961.08,964.31,Participant,catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down
225,965.04,969.95,Participant,she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke
226,970.71,978.03,Participant,and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her

228,981.32,987.98,Participant,there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her

243,1050.86,1058.26,Participant,and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well
244,1056.14,1056.54,Ellie,mhm
245,1058.71,1065.39,Participant,is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs

275,1184.24,1190.23,Participant,and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment

281,1210.31,1210.61,Participant,but
282,1212.4,1214.15,Participant,how could i convince myself of that
283,1215.46,1218.8,Participant,um two weeks after she died i wound up with

287,1238.54,1240.78,Participant,i mean i wound up having to take more medication
288,1241.51,1242.34,Participant,because of that
289,1243.26,1247.21,Participant,uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to
290,1248.02,1253.6,Participant,get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like
291,1255.56,1260.61,Participant,the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so
292,1259.82,1260.23,Ellie,yeah
293,1261.36,1271.56,Participant,that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore 
294,1272.28,1272.83,Participant,so
295,1273.34,1283.29,Participant,and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just
296,1284.52,1286.78,Participant,you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now
297,1288.02,1288.42,Participant,and it
298,1289.39,1290.06,Participant,it's been
299,1291.44,1294.57,Participant,a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up
300,1295.76,1298.87,Participant,just stay in bed and sleep all day you know
301,1299.6,1300.1,Participant,but then
302,1301.24,1302.55,Participant,realizing that
303,1304.7,1311.55,Participant,when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well
304,1312.58,1319.29,Participant,they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies
305,1319.62,1319.96,Ellie,uh huh
306,1320.52,1322.58,Participant,i took that responsibility of doing it for them
307,1323.82,1336.65,Participant,so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't
308,1337.48,1337.95,Ellie,yeah
309,1337.56,1338.87,Participant,they didn't you know so
310,1339.62,1342.35,Participant,they eh they actually got me up and
311,1344.92,1356.81,Participant,and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them
312,1357.56,1360.66,Participant,if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been
313,1361.65,1364.36,Participant,you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably 
314,1364.96,1371.91,Participant,and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for 
315,1372.84,1377.28,Participant,for me i mean for me making selfish decisions  
316,1374.04,1374.42,Ellie,mhm
317,1378.03,1386.16,Participant,so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is
318,1386.79,1396.74,Participant,to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care  
319,1397.15,1400.15,Participant,as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but
320,1401.27,1403.26,Participant,i have a family to look after now 
321,1404.28,1406.03,Participant,so i have to go out and do things 
322,1406.49,1406.89,Ellie,yeah
323,1406.65,1411.97,Participant,you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know  
324,1412.55,1418.76,Participant,but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm  
325,1419.45,1421.88,Participant,been working on on a balance of the two
326,1422.5,1423.44,Ellie,how hard is that 
327,1425.0,1427.84,Participant,very <laughter> but it's worth it
328,1428.74,1429.23,Participant,i mean 
329,1430.57,1437.75,Participant,it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter> 
330,1438.46,1440.03,Participant,but keeping
331,1441.07,1443.84,Participant,a residence down paying bills things like that 
332,1446.05,1454.18,Participant,it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that 
333,1454.8,1455.27,Ellie,yeah
334,1455.38,1456.86,Participant,and i and and i know that 
335,1457.73,1458.05,Participant,but 
336,1458.7,1461.38,Participant,it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up 
337,1462.11,1462.59,Participant,but then 
338,1463.52,1465.49,Participant,it's like well what's the alternative 
339,1467.02,1469.44,Participant,i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life 
340,1470.24,1477.03,Participant,'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna 
341,1477.85,1483.33,Participant,be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever 
342,1484.28,1485.5,Participant,and i wouldn't get anything done 
343,1486.6,1487.13,Ellie,i see
344,1488.19,1489.72,Ellie,how have you been feeling lately 
345,1490.94,1491.98,Participant,uh very 
346,1492.74,1496.78,Participant,anxious and nervous and i mean what if 
347,1498.04,1499.17,Participant,i don't find 
348,1500.56,1506.7,Participant,enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um 
349,1508.52,1509.94,Participant,you know what what if i can't  
350,1511.62,1511.99,Participant,keep
351,1513.19,1521.03,Participant,a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but 
352,1522.31,1525.1,Participant,what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs 
353,1525.93,1532.2,Participant,and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that 
354,1532.76,1534.84,Participant,but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in 
355,1535.87,1537.33,Participant,so that's actually 
356,1538.62,1540.19,Participant,a source of 
357,1541.93,1542.69,Participant,anxiety 
358,1543.93,1550.67,Participant,but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it 
359,1551.97,1553.66,Participant,but i i i know it it's a cycle
360,1552.65,1553.19,Ellie,that's good 
361,1554.34,1561.17,Participant,and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is
362,1562.37,1564.25,Participant,the fundamental thing i need to take of here 
363,1565.33,1570.21,Participant,i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what
364,1571.05,1574.15,Participant,is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue 
365,1574.62,1575.07,Ellie,mhm
366,1575.13,1575.63,Participant,and so 
367,1576.77,1580.39,Participant,figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit
368,1581.05,1584.52,Participant,but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again 
369,1585.3,1586.67,Participant,mm i'll have to 
370,1587.97,1588.32,Participant,uh 
371,1589.62,1599.5,Participant,figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it  
372,1600.2,1602.11,Participant,you get over it pretty quickly you get through it 
373,1602.79,1603.29,Ellie,yes
374,1604.98,1607.48,Ellie,when was the last time you felt really happy 
375,1609.02,1610.94,Participant,the last time i felt really happy
376,1613.2,1613.84,Participant,i don't know
377,1614.66,1614.99,Participant,zz

379,1622.65,1622.87,Participant,i 
380,1626.35,1631.21,Participant,huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me 
381,1632.17,1638.09,Participant,because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda
382,1638.89,1640.1,Participant,eh in the middle
383,1641.07,1641.5,Participant,um
384,1642.89,1646.75,Participant,really like overjoyously happy i don't know 
385,1648.46,1652.78,Participant,i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened
386,1655.22,1655.7,Ellie,okay 
387,1657.88,1659.46,Ellie,how would your best friend describe you 
388,1663.93,1665.14,Participant,i don't know you don't know 
389,1666.08,1668.33,Participant,perceptions of other people i mean 
390,1671.34,1673.3,Participant,probably as somebody who 
391,1676.55,1681.15,Participant,oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know 
392,1682.48,1685.46,Participant,handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that  
393,1685.99,1686.32,Participant,at all
394,1687.58,1688.12,Participant,and it's a it
395,1687.85,1690.19,Ellie,what would you say are some of your best qualities

397,1695.94,1697.67,Participant,i'm not afraid to 
398,1699.01,1703.6,Participant,hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done 
399,1704.76,1705.69,Participant,um that

401,1710.59,1711.91,Participant,strive for balance 
402,1712.44,1712.76,Participant,probably 
403,1714.16,1715.72,Participant,probably the best things about me <laughter>

408,1730.51,1730.98,Participant,um
409,1732.65,1740.61,Participant,you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to 
410,1741.24,1745.25,Participant,who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got
411,1746.19,1748.39,Participant,a career that she 
412,1749.79,1751.79,Participant,it's more of a job that she fell into 
413,1752.74,1759.27,Participant,'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer 
414,1753.04,1753.43,Ellie,uh huh
415,1759.71,1763.65,Participant,and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time  
416,1764.99,1769.7,Participant,but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and
417,1770.3,1774.3,Participant,she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda
418,1775.65,1778.63,Participant,stole all the money from her business so she lost her business  
419,1779.2,1783.98,Participant,and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early 
420,1779.33,1779.84,Ellie,uh oh 
421,1784.46,1789.16,Participant,she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it  
422,1789.82,1793.28,Participant,and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it 
423,1793.93,1794.41,Ellie,yeah
424,1794.6,1797.2,Participant,and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is 
425,1798.26,1803.45,Participant,yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can 
426,1803.88,1809.18,Participant,be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me 
427,1810.35,1812.38,Participant,people i actually like in my life and 
428,1813.19,1814.15,Participant,be happy with that 
429,1815.04,1817.13,Participant,and i see a lot of people who aren't 
430,1817.78,1824.21,Participant,and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that 
431,1825.11,1825.47,Ellie,yeah 
432,1825.11,1831.98,Participant,and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now
