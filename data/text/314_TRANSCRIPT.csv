133,480.26,483.53,Participant,yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens
134,484.08,489.73,Participant,because i i like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if i'm thinking something
135,490.35,493.25,Participant,i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up
136,494.295,495.235,Ellie,that's good

143,513.665,515.935,Participant,you know as life goes on he'll learn more
144,516.245,519.275,Participant,he's very confident and very self uh
145,520.295,525.88,Participant,self uh what's the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct
146,526.52,527.3,Participant,and
147,527.615,530.055,Participant,he still has a lot of learning to do that's all

159,558.42,559.72,Participant,but um
160,561.275,565.695,Participant,you know given that with all the technology we have there's really not any way to go back so i
161,566.31,571.035,Participant,i have um hope that um
162,571.415,572.455,Participant,they will
163,572.97,577.35,Participant,i mean i think this country was built on on uh hard work and and ethics

355,1157.275,1159.195,Participant,which is a whole different experience
356,1159.69,1164.69,Participant,so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery
357,1165.02,1165.45,Ellie,uh huh
358,1165.47,1170.65,Participant,but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you
359,1171.32,1175.965,Participant,even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like
360,1177.095,1180.445,Participant,so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood
361,1180.565,1183.215,Participant,um about fifteen years ago
362,1183.325,1186.345,Participant,'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old
363,1186.83,1187.9,Participant,so um
364,1188.89,1189.34,Participant,yeah
365,1190.42,1190.96,Participant,and i've been

367,1192.86,1193.85,Participant,um
368,1194.03,1197.98,Participant,well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but
369,1198.65,1200.58,Participant,uh and you know also like
370,1200.8,1207.89,Participant,for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business
371,1208.36,1216.12,Participant,and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me
372,1216.6,1223.645,Participant,so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the
373,1224.037,1224.527,Participant,um
374,1225.687,1230.807,Participant,the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby

387,1262.265,1263.415,Ellie,whatever comes to your mind

393,1276.525,1280.025,Participant,sense of joy excitement relief

396,1287.11,1288.75,Participant,going forward from there but it's
397,1289.595,1293.715,Participant,it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome
398,1294.315,1295.495,Participant,after you give birth
399,1297.13,1299.12,Ellie,that sounds like a great situation
400,1297.19,1300.125,Participant,and i have experienced both ways i've done both um
401,1300.632,1301.642,Participant,natural and
402,1301.992,1305.1019999999999,Participant,my last child was via c_section so i've had both
403,1305.872,1308.182,Participant,both um experiences
404,1309.692,1310.262,Ellie,mhm
405,1312.632,1313.932,Ellie,is there anything you regret
406,1315.1570000000002,1316.1970000000001,Participant,um
407,1318.892,1322.432,Participant,i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little
408,1323.047,1327.3970000000002,Participant,psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny
409,1328.0870000000002,1329.007,Ellie,[laughter]
410,1328.092,1329.892,Participant,and um she
411,1330.757,1335.402,Participant,she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was
412,1336.2420000000002,1339.642,Participant,born very quickly after he broke the water and oof
413,1340.277,1343.787,Participant,my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble
414,1344.547,1346.977,Participant,because i only had like two contractions after that
415,1347.0870000000002,1348.067,Ellie,oh no
416,1347.352,1348.8020000000001,Participant,my daughter was born in the bed
417,1349.602,1352.672,Participant,so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but
418,1353.5220000000002,1355.5020000000002,Participant,um i'm sure they weren't happy
419,1355.727,1357.5970000000002,Participant,to fill out a lot of paper work after that
420,1358.6770000000001,1359.1270000000002,Ellie,yeah
421,1358.6770000000001,1359.1270000000002,Participant,so
422,1360.987,1364.027,Ellie,what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
423,1366.8020000000001,1369.5120000000002,Participant,now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago
424,1370.7820000000002,1371.682,Participant,um
425,1375.517,1377.8270000000002,Participant,ten or twenty years ago i was probably more
426,1378.517,1379.6670000000001,Participant,not as um
427,1380.1270000000002,1382.3670000000002,Participant,relaxed not as um
428,1383.7820000000002,1386.672,Participant,like i feel now at my age that um
429,1389.2620000000002,1393.7320000000002,Participant,i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about
430,1394.342,1398.672,Participant,uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what
431,1399.0420000000001,1399.622,Participant,you know
432,1400.057,1405.7520000000002,Participant,you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care
433,1406.287,1412.3220000000001,Participant,you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever
434,1412.844,1417.129,Participant,so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that
435,1417.639,1422.404,Participant,you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things
436,1423.384,1424.234,Ellie,that makes sense
437,1426.8239999999998,1428.614,Participant,what are you most proud of in your life
438,1429.404,1431.364,Participant,most proud of um
439,1432.864,1436.004,Participant,probably my family my my husband and my
440,1436.4189999999999,1439.924,Participant,my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've
441,1440.124,1442.194,Participant,we're an in tact family that
442,1442.494,1442.944,Participant,um
443,1443.504,1445.904,Participant,my kids see every day how
444,1446.1789999999999,1450.954,Participant,their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and
445,1451.644,1452.744,Participant,they um
446,1453.079,1454.6689999999999,Participant,they actually express
447,1455.069,1459.844,Participant,gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family
448,1460.374,1462.3139999999999,Participant,so i would say that's probably it
449,1462.9089999999999,1463.9489999999998,Ellie,that's great
450,1465.714,1468.004,Ellie,what would you say are some of your best qualities

457,1483.519,1485.089,Participant,through the years i've had a 
458,1485.509,1487.9089999999999,Participant,a lot of experience with um
459,1489.464,1493.4089999999999,Participant,people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and
