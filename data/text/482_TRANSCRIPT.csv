173,499.78,500.34,Participant,um
174,500.83,508.71,Participant,you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted

184,531.12,531.65,Participant,um

191,544.25,544.98,Participant,part partly i
192,545.4,546.29,Participant,the i guess the
193,546.69,553.59,Participant,anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger
194,552.702,553.172,Ellie,mm (mm)
195,554.27,554.87,Participant,so
196,555.44,556.55,Participant,i would think um
197,556.92,560.22,Participant,yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger
198,561.132,561.5319999999999,Ellie,downer (okay)
199,563.121,566.721,Ellie,hard_decisionB (tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make)

204,584.46,586.94,Participant,um i i felt that god had put on my heart that
205,587.36,588.98,Participant,that this was something i was supposed to pursue
206,589.46,591.77,Participant,um my wife didn't feel that way
207,592.44,593.01,Participant,and
208,593.93,594.25,Participant,i
209,595.48,598.62,Participant,i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue
210,599.26,599.83,Participant,and
211,600.71,606.74,Participant,but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart
212,607.26,607.77,Participant,so
213,608.61,610.47,Participant,i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it
214,611.32,615.55,Participant,um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um

217,626.61,631.79,Participant,you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do
218,632.38,632.85,Participant,um
219,633.48,635.74,Participant,but then after i kinda gave that up

221,637.24,637.53,Participant,um
222,638.08,642.83,Participant,then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so
223,643.59,647.06,Participant,um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me
