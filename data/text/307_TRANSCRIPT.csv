83,340.25300000000004,341.70300000000003,Participant,and

87,356.73800000000006,363.55800000000005,Participant,but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess
88,363.76,364.69,Ellie,yeah
89,366.72,369.93,Ellie, when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
90,370.68,372.82,Participant,uh yesterday
91,373.3,380.79,Participant,and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money 
92,381.08,382.77,Participant,and so and
93,383.22,389.81,Participant,so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy
94,390.06,401.69,Participant,and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through
95,390.24,391.63,Ellie,[laughter]
96,402.14,402.94,Ellie,yeah
97,403.82,405.1,Ellie,do you feel that way often

107,435.795,446.82,Participant,um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring
108,447.17199999999997,452.57599999999996,Participant,so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um
109,453.17699999999996,454.69800000000004,Participant, my dream job

111,464.63800000000003,466.51800000000003,Participant,i guess it's something that i realized
112,466.847,468.30699999999996,Participant,i like to see
113,469.44199999999995,491.958,Participant,the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so
114,480.566,481.07599999999996,Ellie,mhm
115,490.656,491.166,Ellie,yeah

125,521.057,528.9540000000001,Participant,i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that
126,529.122,534.32,Participant,i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome
127,534.5840000000001,535.144,Ellie,yeah
128,535.175,542.424,Participant,um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot

133,567.135,568.335,Ellie,i see what you mean
134,569.414,571.234,Ellie,i'd love to hear about one of your trips

140,600.5169999999999,601.487,Ellie,oh my gosh
141,601.477,612.4730000000001,Participant,i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places
142,612.755,625.621,Participant,i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so
143,626.059,626.6990000000001,Participant,um
144,627.139,637.448,Participant,and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made
145,637.7909999999999,645.129,Participant,and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like
146,645.913,654.185,Participant,white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful
147,654.34,655.94,Participant,or something that's different too

158,691.875,698.066,Participant,i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of 
159,698.424,701.3439999999999,Participant,energizing me so no it's not too bad
160,701.79,702.7,Participant,that's good

162,709.758,722.85,Participant,uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in
163,723.416,724.2660000000001,Participant,so

167,733.8610000000001,749.684,Participant,yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for
168,743.7689999999999,744.3589999999999,Ellie,mhm
169,749.98,761.1310000000001,Participant,so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck
170,761.508,766.426,Participant,barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like
171,767.2819999999999,774.7819999999999,Participant,when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know
172,774.85,776.41,Ellie,that sounds really hard
173,776.7589999999999,782.55,Participant,yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so
174,782.9060000000001,800.323,Participant,but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh
