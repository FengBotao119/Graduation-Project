31,229.737,232.732,Participant,things i don't like about l_a or say california in general
32,233.032,234.582,Participant,say like the high tax rate
33,235.15200000000002,239.912,Participant,which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now
34,240.167,243.157,Participant,which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations
35,243.317,244.787,Participant,i'm a small business owner
36,245.327,256.142,Participant,so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated
37,256.76,259.99,Participant,and uh that's a big problem here in uh
38,260.25,262.16,Participant,uh california
39,262.55,263.39,Ellie,that_sucks (that sucks)
40,263.485,267.21,Participant,it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh
41,267.96,269.06,Participant,also uh
42,270.315,276.67,Participant,you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't
43,277.127,280.937,Participant,see that but it's a big tax on the social service system
44,281.337,283.107,Participant,and that's what makes our taxes
45,283.507,287.47700000000003,Participant,uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of
46,288.065,288.535,Ellie,mm (mm)
47,288.627,289.447,Participant,so that's
48,290.092,300.099,Participant,you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state
49,300.925,301.435,Ellie,mhm (mhm)
50,302.21299999999997,308.394,Ellie,travel_shoes (i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot)

75,372.574,373.274,Participant,sure
76,373.499,383.219,Participant,um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span
77,383.501,391.191,Participant,but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times
78,391.51099999999997,395.57099999999997,Participant,we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local
79,395.856,397.89599999999996,Participant,and rented a small flat and
80,398.661,401.151,Participant,cooked and did our own shopping but really
81,401.566,404.89599999999996,Participant,having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days

83,410.861,414.461,Participant,and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french
84,414.82599999999996,419.711,Participant,which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger
85,419.95599999999996,422.44599999999997,Participant,my mother insisted that all of us kids
86,422.656,427.88599999999997,Participant,take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh
87,428.716,433.256,Participant,all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school
88,433.834,434.564,Ellie,nice (nice)
89,434.126,439.32599999999996,Participant,so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french
90,439.486,440.486,Participant,with the french
91,440.721,446.106,Participant,you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me

98,461.131,462.541,Participant,and uh

107,478.796,479.996,Participant,and uh
108,480.901,482.601,Participant,it was something that i wanted to do
109,482.736,486.921,Participant,where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports
110,487.301,491.76599999999996,Participant,and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland
111,492.231,494.27099999999996,Participant,and i originally wanted to be a doctor but
112,494.716,496.416,Participant,once you start going to school
113,496.64099999999996,498.731,Participant,for a little bit you change your mind
114,499.101,500.381,Participant,etcetera so
115,500.335,500.845,Ellie,mhm (mhm)
116,502.673,503.93300000000005,Ellie,still_working_on_X (are you still working in that)
117,504.686,508.986,Participant,um i'm actually in the wholesale business now
118,509.486,512.751,Participant,for wholesale distributors of furniture products
119,513.566,517.276,Participant,and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago
120,517.56,522.895,Participant,well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business
121,523.15,524.57,Participant,and it's
122,525.095,527.825,Participant,pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it
123,528.175,530.635,Participant,but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past
124,531.429,532.629,Ellie,dream_job (what's your dream job)
125,533.83,534.47,Participant,hm
126,534.875,542.18,Participant,actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home
127,542.705,544.125,Participant,and uh
128,545.14,545.98,Participant,uh
129,546.665,551.315,Participant,i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter
130,551.99,553.2,Participant,and uh
131,552.325,553.005,Ellie,aw (aw)
132,553.955,557.735,Participant,you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked
133,558.32,566.85,Participant,but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids
134,567.25,575.34,Participant,you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life
135,575.54,576.04,Participant,so
136,576.082,576.552,Ellie,yeah3 (yeah)
137,576.5,579.23,Participant,probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun
138,582.0840000000001,586.503,Ellie,shyoutgoing (do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing)
139,585.72,591.42,Participant,uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers
140,591.84,594.65,Participant,but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable
141,595.25,597.68,Participant,i think i'm more of an extrovert
142,598.28,601.29,Participant,whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted
143,601.48,612.68,Participant,but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation
144,613.84,616.61,Participant,and be more um
145,617.29,618.32,Participant,introverted
146,618.89,627.025,Participant,i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved
147,628.0509999999999,628.511,Ellie,okay_confirm (okay)
148,631.516,643.294,Ellie,relax_fishtank (sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax)
149,643.1519999999999,646.072,Participant,oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh
150,646.587,649.4119999999999,Participant,one of my i have uh several computers at home
151,649.972,653.222,Participant,and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well
152,653.752,667.922,Participant,i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach
153,668.457,673.082,Participant,you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes
154,674.012,677.737,Participant,it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years
155,678.302,679.182,Participant,i had
156,679.707,680.477,Participant,it uh
157,681.217,684.827,Participant,i usually find exercise helps me relax the best
158,685.107,689.2869999999999,Participant,or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter>
159,690.952,695.895,Participant,but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but
160,696.5260000000001,697.426,Ellie,thats_great (that's great)
161,698.215,699.945,Participant,yes that was uh
162,700.235,701.165,Participant,that was it but
163,701.515,706.535,Participant,that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills
164,706.7,709.54,Participant,i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years
165,710.01,711.8,Participant,i think i've gotten better
166,712.53,713.905,Participant,uh at the
167,712.868,713.398,Ellie,yeah2 (yeah)
168,714.74,717.28,Participant,i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature
169,717.795,720.615,Participant,as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and
170,721.165,722.295,Participant,be a little more
171,722.815,724.925,Participant,how do you had had the skills earlier
172,727.187,729.247,Ellie,control_temper (how are you at controlling your temper)
173,729.965,734.38,Participant,i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged
174,734.99,736.06,Participant,um
175,736.45,737.41,Participant,you know i
176,738.235,742.355,Participant,i am more likely to think before i speak now
177,742.58,746.44,Participant,whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought
178,747.115,749.245,Participant,so i might've said more things that i
179,750.105,753.775,Participant,in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or
180,754.3,755.75,Participant,a work situation
181,756.48,757.45,Participant,um
182,757.75,765.025,Participant,but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it
183,765.31,769.72,Participant,i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties
184,769.903,770.373,Ellie,uh_huh (uh huh)
185,771.34,775.42,Participant,so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity
186,776.7539999999999,779.804,Ellie,last_argument (when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about)
187,779.83,780.85,Participant,oh wow
188,781.275,786.595,Participant,you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional
189,787.64,789.53,Participant,argument um
190,790.26,791.33,Participant,probably
191,792.39,793.28,Participant,um
192,793.67,798.62,Participant,my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter
193,799.12,801.55,Participant,and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just
194,801.7,806.885,Participant,basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting
195,807.71,809.31,Participant,and uh just
196,810.155,813.415,Participant,uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused
197,813.84,817.03,Participant,us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument
198,817.44,821.755,Participant,but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree
199,822.28,823.15,Participant,butt heads
200,823.37,823.89,Participant,so
201,824.49,826.03,Ellie,describe_felt (how did you feel in that moment)
202,827.705,829.785,Participant,i felt like i was talking to a wall
203,830.26,833.33,Participant,and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've
204,833.99,840.06,Participant,learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should
205,840.815,844.065,Participant,usually have but you're not really thinking of that because
206,844.44,845.74,Participant,sometimes when we're younger we're
207,846.285,850.445,Participant,looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me
208,850.885,852.085,Participant,but you know
