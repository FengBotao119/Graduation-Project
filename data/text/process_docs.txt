good atlanta georgia um my parents are from here um i love it i like the weather i like the opportunities um yes um it took a minute somewhat easy congestion thats it um i took up business and administration uh yeah i am here and there im on a break right now but i plan on going back in the uh next semester uh probably to open up my own business no um no specific reason i just dont travel a lot im pretty local once a year can you be a little bit more specific no answer i like reading books i enjoy i enjoy cooking um exercising is great im im im pretty good at it um yeah um probably about two weeks ago uh frustrated um i dont like bias um i dont like um when someone says theyre gonna do something and they dont uh somewhat friendship i like to play sports i enjoy uh going out with friends and family playing games grandparents parents um yeah i mean theyve always given me great advice theyve always kept it real real close i would say going to college right after high school well i wouldve been done by now you know i would have been probably out in the field in the career field uh taking a job off the street im sure i couldve yes im not sure maybe when i graduated from high school well uh i um i got my diploma my my diploma that i finished school and i met all the requirements  high school and i was approved to go do whatever i wanted to do living with who um its alright it could be better not no uh its pretty easy uh yes repeat that irritated um lazy no no no no um the other day weather was great sun was out different less less um interested uh shut down uh about two weeks ago uh yeah a friend of mine was annoying me and i just cut them off laughter its alright friendship chocolate tall thin thank you bye bye
thank you mmm k im doing good thank you im from los angeles oh great i live in west los angeles the west side its alright i xxx no i live alone so i love it im from here so i grew up here its natural the weather um well the weather its always good its never its never bad uh um theres always something to do its rarely a dull moment the traffic the traffic is horrible well probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but i hate the traffic not really i mean i have enough things going on here so if i travel its usually somewhere thats within driving distance i studied uh business i did no ive ive been done for a few years so i havent gone to school for a while one of these days ill go back to graduate school but my dream job would be to just work for myself and making lots of money um i dont know i dont really have a dream job just something that i can i can work under my own terms and get paid decently and and be in a creative creative environment um i dont know i think its just a matter of finding the right situation so right now eh its been people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they want it so its a little tougher than it seems se it should be but i dont know i think when the situations right i dont think its too difficult yep i work as an assistant as administrative assistant through a temp agency so its just basically i get sent out to do uh to do desk jobs  um yes and no i mean i feel like i feel like i could do more but you know it works so  you know yeah im pretty close i mean theyre around so um god really mad stupid people just basically doing just doing anything to annoy me um thats basically ba thats the big thing just just irritating stupid people laughter who just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all um whats a good example just random people who who think its funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesnt have to be one any specific situation its just people who just think its funny to i think theyre just generally sadistic and they just think its its funny to to just prod you like its like poking a stick at an angry dog knowing that they know how to they just wanna push your buttons for no reason so uh god i dont remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember laughter when when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past is the past i just tend not to look back what do you mean okay god what do i do to relax i like to run i like to go to the gym listen to music i have a lot of musician friends so i just so im usually around musicians so anything of that sort i like i like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to just anything thats thats generally art and creative whos been a positive pos i think its just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they theyre very inspiring and which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybodys on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they dont its sometimes hard to find someone whos gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so i dont really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey youre good at this why arent you doing that or something like that just you know im always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently instead of just being negative saying hey dont do that thats no thats why are you doing that its a waste of time um i guess it depends on who you talk to im im okay at it i could probably work at that um i dont know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me but i dont know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress lately ive been better at it just because i think my situations been a little bit better no no no um nothing major i mean maybe when i was younger i couldve traveled more or i couldve worked towards something that paid better jobwise but i mean those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda wouldve done but you know but then again i think thats natural for anybody i mean i could i couldve become a banker or i couldve become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but but then again i dont like the law and i dont like medicine so so im it wasnt meant to be so yeah so um i think i think my in my life i knew that i theres a lot of things i have ha theres more dislikes laughter than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of mmm kind of answered itself so no it i dont think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it its kind of a good thing cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesnt really fit you doesnt make sense its like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and its like it just no matter how you try to shove it in its not gonna go in so sometimes its just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you memorable experiences um hmm i think its just i dont really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether its positive or negative i think its just everything from getting it just just the fact that i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that im able im able to get this far in life without like completely selfdestructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like ive gotten somewhere maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why arent you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire yeah um when was the last time i really felt happy um i dont know im not really someone whos like i dont have any real high highs or low lows i mean i havent hit any lows so i mean i i dont know im usually pretty i feel like im a level person and im pretty happy ha every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then im pretty happy so i guess to answer the question probably mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if im able to accomplish something then then hey im happy i dont know i dont really have a best friend but i mean i well to answer the question generally friends i think they would say that im very ver pretty outgoing im pretty determined im trying you know i try to you know i try to interact as much as possible im always out networking as much as possible so i dont know i guess thats basically what i think they would describe me as okay no problem alright bye
im fine how about yourself  im from los angeles california what part  okay  um all my familys here friends a mixture of people and a lot of things to do early childhood education no not right now but i would love to get back into it love working with kids seeing them smile um guess it goes back to when i was a kid uh i like being happy and playful so i guess it just transferred into my adult life working with kids as a school teacher or in that capacity yeah it is but if its a passion of yours itll always be fun im very close sometimes too close um i have four sisters and one brother on my moms side and on my dad i have six brothers and four sisters and were all getting intertwined together so so thats why i say were too close sometimes no i have a lot of friends to interact with and uh were always doing different things so thats why i say im not curse laughter just let it out a couple days ago my nephew didnt call me back um kinda mad cause i had set aside some time to spend with him and he just blew it off and didnt call me back yeah i know mm im okay when my mother passed uh its been about five years now to the day so its its getting better time makes it easier a lot cause theres a lot of things that make me think about her in a daily basis anything uh driving by a particular restaurant that she likes uh watching different tv shows just anything that could trigger a a memory of my mom yesterday uh think about the good times and i dont stay in that place too long just go ahead and think about it and move on mm not officially but i think i might be depressed well i mean since my mom passed its been kinda rough and then um job situation is not stable here in california so that has a lot to do with it as well so yeah it is but kinda sort of kinda just to myself reserved  mm not really its pretty easy grumpy irritable fidgety just a big ball of nerves  uh what do you mean uh i guess so yeah i like to travel meeting new people different locations scenery uh different opportunities to try something new in a new location uh just came back from memphis about three weeks ago go and see family and friends uh it was pretty nice got a chance to see um something new change cha change of scenery wow stick to the plan and dont veer off to the left or right just go straight ahead um  just different circumstances in life that gradually pushed me towards the left and the right every day uh a few relationships not staying in school um missing out on great opportunities with employers um funny loyal spontaneous life of the party grew up together in the same community went to school together high school friends uh my big sister michelle uh my friend troy um i mean theres others but those two uh no matter good or bad theyre always in my corner for me thank you yesterday yester yesterday celebrated a birthday oh it was just a little small intimate setting  cooked a a meal had family and friends over listened to music watched movie talked about the old days when my mom was here and when we were all one union so it was just a nice evening thank you bye bye
okay how bout yourself here in california yeah oh well that its big and broad theres a lot to do a lot of um um job opportunities than other states um pretty much that its big and theres a lot you can do here traffic um maybe the violence rate bad news even though you know you wanna know whats going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see whats going on on a daily basis sociology i have a um two year degree in liberal arts but my major was sociology no im actually an mta bus operator well since metro is steady growing um my dream job is to move up in the company and im about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week so um cause they look to promote within the company so thats the good thing theres a lot of opportunities at metro where you can take classes and theyll pay for your tuition and things of that nature thanks well its not actually hard as right now its easy if you take advantage of it right now cause they look to promote within so you know so since im already working there thats a good thing so its good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that youre interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible  what do you mean im sorry okay read take a long walk hot bath meditate just close my eyes sometimes im pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you gotta remain calm and still remain professional at the same time well i look at it like it it goes with i mean it comes with experience you know um you do something on a continuous basis usually you some somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i i look at it like that so ive been driving for years and dealing with the public so its just how you handle circumstances you you know treat people like you wanna be treated no im pretty good at it now maybe when i was younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and im still learning today i would say my family you know my kids you know even though you know i had been having a lot of deaths around me but thats just go thats part of the life experience you know you born here but you gotta leave here one day but my kids will keep me you know sane and you know i love them and my family   thank you no laughter um setting good examples you know because youre the first teacher you know and you wanna set a positive good example for your kids and i think thats a good thing and it starts at home well um by you being the first teacher your kids youre youre their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatevers been taught in the home they lookin and learning every day you know whether its a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean  so you try to keep it positive teach em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature i have a um four and a half year old son i have a seven year old daughter and i also have a twenty three year old yeah im bout to be well my daughters pregnant with a boy she has three um little girls so i have three grandkids and um one on the way which is a boy this time yeah thank you the hardest thing is well right now im a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and they can be expensive at times you know it depends on the persons situation you know the whether they have help or a job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but its hard you know but you i try to you know keep a job keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can with my kids or just period whats memorable for me is that im the only one in my family with a degree so its kinda like yeah its kinda even though im the baby of ten kids you know and ive always kept that in the back of my mind even though everybody well pretty much my whole family have decent job but im the only one with a degree so i kinda like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know i just thats the only thing i remember graduating you know and my family there and to support me  thank you happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelors degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like its never too late so i feel like ill take some classes now that im with metro to help me move up the ladder so  thats why im starting a class next week thank you hm well the advice i wouldve gave myself that i probably wouldnt have been a young mother at a young age and that i probably wouldve stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i wouldve remained in school i probably wouldnt have had kids early you know um rather i probably wouldve stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day so i think thats a plus you know in anybodys shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career im not quite sure um you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you dont continue to make the same ones i feel like its okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though im going to school late but still im going you know i wanna better myself career wise so  yes my oldest daughter we had a argument because just the life that shes living right now and the things that shes going through and um i had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation and uh we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes dont wanna hear it you know hear the stuff that youre saying even though its true or  or they just you know well they just dont wanna hear it you know they may be going through something they dont wanna hear but we got into a argument about it but that just happened you know i just told her im not im sorry very close very close its just that the the situation my daughters in she just needs to make some changes to better her her life and Ill be telling shes um shes kinda like stubborn in her own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your moms not gonna tell you nothing wrong and ive been telling her over the years you know different things and its its kinda like i was talking to a wall because she she did the opposite and now shes she regretting it you know cause shes like my mom told me this you know mom im doing the opposite so i guess she gotta bump her head a couple of times to get it its kinda like i done told you i done left it alone and now its up to you to make the change its very frustrating because its like im talking to a wall and shes not hearing me and im like it seem like its taking forever for her to change but its left up to the individual whenever theyre ready you know what i mean once the person get tired of something theyll make it change it may not be when you want it to happen but the ball is her court you know i only can do so much oh wow i have my days um since i have two little ones um i kinda like trained them to go to bed at eight o clock because you know they gotta go to school and i think its important to have a good nights rest because it kinda like clears throat it it kinda like gets you ready for the next day or you know how you gonna feel if you rested what type of person youll be that day you know cause everybody have they days whether theyre good or bad but thats just a part of life and i feel like if you had a good nights good good nights rest hopefully youll have a good day you know pretty much you know i need my rest because im out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people and you know  the job itself if very stressful so i feel like if im rested itll help me what am i like irritated tired um lazy you know feel like i wanna lay down probably go to sleep laughter get the rest that i need but laughter i never thought about that i just you know cause like i said you know everybody have their moments they do i never thought about that hm no no i dont really have a best friend but a person that i deal with and i used to work with um she would probably tell you that im very um outgoing a go getter dependable responsible im a um people person i get along with others you know im kinda like um i leave a good a a good mark whether i know you or not if you was to you know like  like you and i now you know i um youd probably say oh she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that thank you well i try to stay happy id rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going you know what i mean especially when i go to pick them up from school or their being hey mom you know that just kinda make my day just them run up to me you know and be happy and excited you know what i mean  thank you youre more than welcome you have a good day goodbye

im doing alright uh originally im from california uh born in glendale im not too happy with it uh just unemployed at the moment but uh actively seeking uh uh doing what im supposed to be doing uh there are some uh  some prospects there but hopefully ill learn something today yeah well i have one its a girlfriend so i consider her a roommate a lover type thing pardon me um were pretty close uh i met her last year and uh weve been through some troubling times but uh were starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel uh the troubling times uh i would let me see uh well i had uh gotten a dui last year and uh lost my job im a truck driver by trade so  uh that kinda threw me way off uh having a fourteen hundred dollar a week job uh and then going to nothing kinda like plus losing my my license kinda really threw me off and uh I couldnt um i havent really uh found anything that i was interested in uh so i started cooking and our trying to see which other route i can go as far as uh having some kind of a career and uh so im choose choosing to go into the culinary field but you know uh meanwhile i still have to work its hard to find work with uh without going to school  and uh so but i think today uh i applied at ralphs so hopefully ill get that job i should have that job actually so um but im starting to see a light like i said at the end of the tunnel now a little by little my dream job would be probably forestry service out in the wilderness yeah i like being alone pardon me well you know i have a a lot of for animals im an exotic animal trainer by trade and uh so and i like  being i dont like people too much uh so being outdoors and uh ive always enjoyed being outdoors thats how i like being a truck driver ive traveled the world i dont necessarily like being in a warehouse or an office im of a a outdoors type of guy so uh one of my trips would be uh i spent a year and a half in japan and uh on the uh lower island uh there that uh they built that bridge  uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh i went there to work for  uh for an all white oh uh an all white tiger act and uh working for a japanese circus  so it was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadnt really seen a lot of americans  cause that was also one of the islands that we uh that they bombed  so there was a lot of negativity but i i pretty have a good idea out you know outlook uh on life uh especially during those times you know i i enjoyed myself you know through all the traveling and and meeting new people and um eating you know different um diverse foods and uh it was a good experience for me  all of that whole experience was pretty good for me you know just traveling around with circuses and uh  you know its been great uh probably um one some of the things i like about la theres not a lot that i like about la but um i like hollywood i like the the the movie industry um the uh huge uh um different different people you know different uh different ethnics of uh people here you know uh i enjoy talking to uh few you know a lot of foreigners you know i like to see where they came from and and what what its like there  traffics atrocious you know traffic laughter uh ignorance uh being disrespected uh being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful toward you or other people um thats about it dishonesty pardon me uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh you know or i if im riding my bike uh people tend to almost run me over so if im not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes you know having to wait to see what theyre gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that yeah big time what do i do when im annoyed um probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times its im myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis   and if i wasnt paying attention id be up shit creek uh its hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react cause theres consequences for your reactions um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh  um im pretty honest with im open and honest about any anything and everything and uh what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just you know didnt like that at all pardon me um im trying to im missing the word for it uh just that i dont know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well thats probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest  um i dont like i said i dont hold back and im pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so you know and if youre lying about something well you just youre always having to cover up uh more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just dont see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now im i you know is it truthful is it not you know so its kinda hurt our relationship cant do nothing about it uh fun i like going to the beach uh i love shooting darts but i havent done it in a while i i love i love to paint uh i got into watercolor painting  and im pretty gifted at that and um uh i wanna try some other mediums and uh lets see here i love fishing uh havent gone in a while though and uh i like driving a truck you know uh its you know my job you know i was a i really really enjoyed it i dont like driving through cities but uh usually when im in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like star gazing ill see if i can um pick out some of those uh astronomy uh stars up up there and um  im a pretty easy going guy so shooting pool um sunshine just those i like uh most memorable experiences um good or bad uh most memorable experiences uh probably uh playing with lions and tigers uh uh wrestling a a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle uh uh just enjoying myself i know not uh i dont have much family as it is uh at least here in the states i dont my moms from central america so uh  but im not close to i have uh  three brothers one sister and im probably not really really close to none of my siblings i speak with one brother uh quite a bit um my other youngest brother you know he he just id just rather not  you know i converse con converse with him but its you know just i try to keep it on a professional basis my sister i dont talk to at all my my other brother underneath me i havent spoken to him in years so im just close with my mom uh my niece some of my nephews and thats about it have i done anything to avoid it um to avoid them uh yeah i just dont talk to them i dont call them i dont ask about them i you know i talk to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just dont bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just usually say you know thats on them and i really dont wanna deal with them so um its been hard lately its been probably hard for the last uh going on a year um you know i uh depends on my thought process at the time i like i said ive been looking for work quite a bit um so just wondering why you know i dont get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts  so  or i get depressed you know cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over so i dont lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because im so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now its changed to about eight to nine hours and im still tired uh lately i have been probably about the last few months um tired laughter um i you know if i dont sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know im more of a guy you know i love to work um and if im not then its just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head and so you know um i there i either if im busy or im doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh its something new for me and uh so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i dont have to worry about you know um money um you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that  how do i what how do i cope with them um i just try not to think about it uh its its not about whether coping with it or not um i just do its uh im more of a guy that just you know it may take me a moment to to um say that im coping with something but you know it its if i have no control over it theres nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what im doing and thats actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh  interviews uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um back to basics you know i just dont let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me if what has gotten me in trouble my mood swing i mean um yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh uh bother my uh my hiring process i dont know if im gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i ive taken classes on uh  on uh how to interview how to uh how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that thats not who  who i wanna be anymore so or you know i ive done  uh ive done uh ive done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and  and try to uh work on the issues that were bothering me so um you know toward positive stuff i got my ged different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didnt go to school and uh anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities  pardon me i still didnt hear you that people have been deceitful can you repeat that one more time alright uh ive been diagnosed with uh bipolarism um its tough if you dont you know um i dont medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but sniff um again its i try to live on life uh i try to live life on lifes terms  and i just you know um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and  and what i dont like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know ive been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um you know some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and so i just try to cope with things uh um its just my life skills you know i i dont i dont wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here im gonna try you on this and or im gonna try you on that  and its just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years actually about three years i kinda just said you know what thats it and um whether its different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it   um i dont think so you know its the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still  uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just and ill deal with it you know sometimes its not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i dont like people um i dont like crowds i dont you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so um but i i get a person you know i its not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh dont mess with this guy or you know um but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus thats how i deal with with with with people because i just know theres consequences if i if i didnt deal with it that way  so i just let it go id rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully its not that bad  did i have a problem before i got out uh well i  i dont know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people  um i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um  a lot of remarks were like oh thats whats wrong you know thats what was wrong with you we we wish that you wouldve wouldve found that out years ago  uh and uh like i dont think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older kind of uh you know makes it work you know me me dealing with life so pardon me uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while uh recently and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um a lot of people may not understand that but uh a therapist is i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatevers bothing me whether it be uh people you know uh uh other issues you know were whatever the case may be  i just think talking about it and theyre such good listeners and can kinda like you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others uh but its always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so  you know but its good to have yeah well i dont go anymore uh so um i kinda miss it you know like i said uh uh i miss it a lot actually but uh its just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will um well monetary reasons and uh you know uh i dont have health insurance theres a lot of things that you know id like to do but i cant you know um  you know money situations not that great right now so how does my friends describe me um they would probably describe me as uh uh energetic uh outgoing person uh once i get to know people um laughs i you know i laugh a i laugh a lot um but uh they would probably tell you that im also very serious and uh  uh hidden person i dont reveal a lot you know and uh so  someone who has been a positive influence in my life someone whos been um someone whos been a positive influence in my life uh probably my boss one of my bosses uh when i first started with uh with exotic animals he was real you know he was uh uh german and um they didnt teach i dont know what he saw in me but he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and um showed a lot of confidence in me and which in in it also built confidence in myself  and uh sort of let me know that you know that theres nothing that i really cant accomplish if i put my mind to it you know yeah it was youre welcome bye laughter
fine uh colorado mhm uh career career possibilities uh paralegal uh for further education for the weather for a friend laughter  not often at all now every few years oh the weather uh the beach sunsets at the beach uh the thought of uh career possibilities um an educated group of people sophisticated market it is an adjustment uh to to come here a lot of people misjudge it a little bit its a laid back appearing town but its actually very um uh sensitive to you know uh success and commericalization and that kind of thing so you have to keep up the pace uh that is a little bit harder i think when you first make the adjustment and pretty soon it becomes obvious that its another market that you just have to work hard in like you you do in others oh be an attorney laughter mhm oh just because you have the uh the power you can use uh you know skills to be able to affect people live peoples lives in a more dramatic way than just being uh an assistant in that field oh uh a lot of it is not around anymore just have brothers and sisters out of state so not particularly close right now uh mm dishonesty unkindness  lack of sympathy uh insensitivity you know uh very good if anything im im uh regressive that way laughter mhm oh wow uh oh just a friend a friend who is who is right now a has a fabulous job is uh spending too much money that he needs to save uh through uh a work situation just a a work connection  mutual friends mhm uh close close now we spend time we have uh we go out and have fun sometimes uh walk walk on the beach uh you know uh shop in beach areas is kind of fun rodeo drive occasionally and uh and see films art art galleries oh uh my daughter i just have one daughter who graduated ucla law school and uh i raised her totally alone without any help so it seemed like an accomplishment that was was worth it the the two jobs and the work uh i think its difficult i think its a difficult job that takes a lot more work than most people give it credit for if you wanna do it right you know its always second guessing your behavior and that kind of thing uh just uh id say peer pressure it can totally alter al alter anything a parent has tried to put into a child thats good scrubbedentry so that was a really bad time for us um i think it depends on which neighborhood or state youre in or the the uh i i think theyre a little misguided i think a little uninspired unin uninspired right now i think theyre being weighed down by the concerns of the wars and um and things like that and i think they can probably use a  uh a common goal a common you know now a team uh as as oppposed to just being more separated group than a family fam once they were i think you know kind of uninspired right now um i worry sometimes about you know work issues but its pretty pretty easy um no i i dont feel like im not sleeping i i just you know will occasionally worry about something at work oh gosh about a couple weeks ago oh just uh you know unfortunately we have to worry you know im fortunate this isnt easier its just cooperation between people uh it solves most everything you know so you always wanna have that around you um just stressed yeah stressed more stressed mhm um yeah fatigue has uh a lot of uh you know a lot of implications for just not feeling like yourself or misjudging things that you might judge differently if you were more well rested uh not depression um probably yeah i was that was considered a possibility i had an employment lawsuit several years ago and and uh actually litigated it and won the settlement um something about whistleblower thing implications im implications of that and um and i was kind of harrassed about it and so i found when i got out of it i couldnt find work right away in my own field so i had to go into a different field go back to ucla and get a new uh professional direction and i found myself fearful sometimes that its gonna happen again you know and you think that would never happen again you know um just that i was noticing that i was noticing i was feeling very uh in my paralegal class i had a a section about employment law and there was a a very complicated filing i had done with great a deal of work and study for my case but once faced with it again in that class setting i just i just couldnt get it done it was a late paper from me and i realized i was traumatized by having to go through that again um that you know yeah post traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down from what i understand and um so i think it was just uh it was just hitting me later you know that i was having to face that paper again and wow you know no adrenaline just wow there is a xxxx back back just uh just extreme uh you know avoidance of getting something done that shouldve been easy for me  and uh and thinking about it as thoroughly as i shouldve or studying it or putting it off uh putting the feeling of going through that paper that type of paper even if its just a class assignment again you know well um not lately um you know back then for sure when that happened which was about ten years ago now it was settled in court about seven years ago now and uh yeah it was it was effective you know it was effective in the way you view most everything and in your confidence and that kinda thing im sorry laughter repeat the question uh peaceful do i feel peaceful well yeah i was peaceful that it that its settled uh but but angry that it ever happened so its hard to ill probably not ever feel peaceful about that issue ever it always the mention of it always makes me angry that i had to go through that yeah i dont think so i tried everything to avoid it laughter you know and so uh uh i think thats that was aggravating for me too because im a patient person realistic and um and i tried everything to avoid uh confrontation in the matter but it was just required to try to you know help me cover the damage to our lives my daughters life i uh not now maybe one time in my life not now you if you cant communicate uh you know if you could communicate you could overcome peoples perceptions or their judgments of you if you can effectively explain something and and uh it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself that others might normally have judgments for age or anything like that um well just raising a daughter extendedly you know or or uh you know just um the experience of thinking thinking that that was a after all the years that was a success her graduating from law school yeah uh just like a lot of work had a good ending uh  you know happy glad that it was fulfilled wishes or or dreams for this child were fulfilled you know that and she was able to make that success wow um laughter i i i tend to be kind of happy with life cause the alternative is gonna harm harm your you know your ability to succeed so i try to force happiness i guess in in most every situation in my life route i find something about it uh when i lost some weight recently that made me really happy i travel a little bit locally i traveled more when i was younger i really enjoyed that but just been too busy in the last few years just new places um ability to take the worries we have every day work  or concerns and kind of put them away for a while and see something new  you know kind of the way im going back to uh colorado san riosco went through vale  and uh and spent the night there and um and it was just during spring when there arent many skiiers and it was just beautiful and very quiet a lot of restaurants with the decks and open in the mountains and it was beautiful yeah wow uh just um ardent im hard working loyal uh um creative um just seeing something that youre creating youre trying to create uh becomes something you hoped the picture would be you know if if thats the case you know just hard work uh just fulfilled or or presented itself in a certain way that you know it makes you happy to my daughter um very ver pretty close she just had a baby shes in the bay area she send me pictures all the time okay bye
laughter um moscow um my family moved to the us and then i moved down here eventually for college  uh it took a long time to ive been living here for about a year since i graduated so theres been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though it goes off and on i have two roommates and theres always a little bit of drama here and there between the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality tv show for a while ones from college and the other one we found on craigslist it varies depending on whether or not were mad at each other so um i guess pretty close right now were kinda distant oh about the distant okay um well we  havent seen each other we havent hung out in like two weeks cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so shes been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no ones really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so its kind of were just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move  its okay itll get better it depends with whom  im dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend its not very good but with other people that i might not know so well then im able to control it a little bit more but itll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger oh cause i dont want them to see me as a bitch laughter yeah uh probably my best friend nicole shes probably been weve been best friends for like god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah um of of what  uh my friend nicole um we met in french class freshman year of high school we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then mhm um uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography um just hanging out with friends i guess whatever uh it varies like im really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um those kinds of things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things  i dont really discuss that with them so i guess superficially close but i rely on them a lot so were close i guess mhm uh thats a good question um i guess it depends who it is again i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant and uh conceited cons uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um what makes me mad thats a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad laughter but its mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess uh yesterday and it was my boyfriend and we argued because hes trying to be healthy and workout and save money  and so and so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so hes not saving money and hes not being healthy and so i got frustrated with him cause im constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time hes like im gonna do it im gonna do it so hes constantly breaking promises thats another thing that makes me angry is people that dont follow through about other people or about myself or angry xxxx laughter um angry i guess ill go with that no i dont feel angry often dang it that is a tough one how bout just getting paid to be me um i dont know that what im kind of trying to figure out right now cause i quit my full time job cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring so now i work in a restaurant job and im trying to look for a second job to support myself um  my dream job i dont know what it would be but i know it would involve people and id love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end i guess its something that i realized i like to see the result from all my hard work cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize its a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so its just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you cant really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography i love cooking baking in particularly so i dont know something in that realm i guess i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling weve gone to gosh seven eight different countries ive lived in three or four different countries i havent traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome um or a huge photographer that travels thatd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so its nice to constantly be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so its nice to stir things up oh gosh okay um im trying to think one of my trips i guess we can talk about i dont know its funny even though ive been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family theres five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon i know needless to say its like when youre that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others nerves but it was really fun and like even though ive traveled so many places i realized that theres like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so um and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i dont know natural wonders also really amaze me cause those things arent man made and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but its like you know you get the same idea like white old white men building great buildings and art work and its beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something thats natural and beautiful or something thats different too cool um pretty easy as long as I get well no i always sleep so easy oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy dont say much and just kinda off in my own world i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and ive been working out more so its kind of  energizing me so no its not too bad thats good uh i guess ive just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh its been about five months since i quit my full time job havent found anything else havent really found anything else im interested in so its more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing yeah its it is hard the market and just like im very picky cause i dont wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for so its just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so its just kinda like im stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but its like when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i dont know yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so but i guess its tough cause a lot of my friends cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend whos teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one whos met the president you know and one thats doing teach for america another friend whos in harvard uh school for like harvard masters mass you know getting her masters so its kind of like ahh all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so uh i do sometimes yes but im going to hawaii next week so right now im fine laughter yes but yeah usually its been kind of like down because im just trying to find like what im supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like its just groceries like i cant even afford groceries so its just hard to like live this way especially after youve paid so much money for like an amazing college education so its a little bit frustrating but theres a lot of people in the same situation its all good uh no i dont think so but i mean i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i dont know if you can but not like medically diagnose im not on meds nope nope oh lets see uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail cause im one of those people if im not gonna be the best at something then im just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home so but i think i wouldve told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means im not gonna be the best at it so ten years ago well that wouldve made me like twelve so  laughter um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act i think i wouldve continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time and i kind of stopped doing those things cause its like oh im not good at it so im not gonna do it and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes  um i dont know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i dont know just expand myself more rather than like find something im good at and just stay with it but never really try harder kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once im good i just stay for good i dont try to go above that if that makes any sense uh right now its super lame but i watch tv laughter but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap or bake but now its just like since im on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like im done so laughter thats a tough question um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college um i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the womens college back east and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like thats out in claremont and um i didnt think i was gonna get in and i was cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i dont think im gonna get in and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing  um but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like um just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy thats probably one yeah it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like lets start this whole thing over so laughter yeah bubbly  fun  maybe moody you never know what youre gonna get sometimes um probably   uh definitely friendly um and pretty like a positive person um but sometimes maybe a little bit aggressive but for the most part i think positive things i mean shes my best friend so laughter huh  really happy oh when i was in mexico over winter well no i dont know my boyfriend took me on a sailing trip down in  san clemente and that was really fun and we just like went sailing and walked around the missions hung out on the beach that was really fun that was a good time yeah it was cool laughter bye

yes fine how about you here yes the weather weather mainly yeah the main ma the weather sorry not the people well some of the people stuff like that some people okay im cutting you off not as much as i used to um i used to be in school i used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that but im not in school right now but later on ill get back into school and ill travel more but right no doubt i dont i dont enjoy traveling uh thats a good question youre actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly yes i am actually right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and im going back to grad school hopefully thats why im nervous sometimes on the questionnaire impressive professor at a place like usc or uc or la or like that where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest youre actually pretty good at this sigh i theres a lot of people the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in ap physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know hes the first one who taught me that school was not about a grade but about learning okay im pretty good i think im single so i dont get in many arguments um but its probably my brother about he always like to uh play a video game together i know im pretty old to play video games but theyre actually pretty good um its probably something like that and me getting angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right thats all fairly close um i see them pretty  pretty often parents i see a couple times a week theyre getting older so ive been helping with groceries things like that and my brother i see  same same with him same amount amo same time my sister i tutor her kids my nephews uh so i see em about once a week also interesting yes because i spend long periods of time doing math and reading and not talking to anybody thats introverted i guess i play video games or and i work out i work out i think a lot i try to at least i roll my eyes which ive been told is a bad thing um and thats about it i think deep breath bad parenting basically parents are more selfcentered more to themselves unlike previous generations and the kids just  do what they want because the parents arent there for fo the parents arent being parents in my personal per own personal opinion sigh um i guess scrubbedentry um scrubbedentry scrubbedentry thank you i dont really have a best friend introverted remember im biased obviously but they are im really good in math im not really sure if you cant not saying you cant get better than me in math but thing is its just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway that type of thing when i a good workout  doing well in video games small little things like that um whats really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood mo that puts me in a good mood thank you right now its the fact that research that i did i did make it this far research wise thats all thats all interesting um when you start off in school you read about einstein and things like that its hes this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know its very complicated things like quantum mechanics and you still havent realized youre interested in that and but youre not sure if you can actually make it and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and thats impressive that you you dont see yourself doing that when youre a kid okay um a few weeks ago when i got a good grade in a class thank you yes briefly  many years ago ag yes i dont know it just always growing up i always thought that was i always thought it was my dream when i was a kid thats why and i just went about doing that  um i was a national guard i think about eighteen nineteen i got commissioned at twenty twenty one and i was only in for about a year so i left at twenty twenty two yes not really i dont think it did i think its just something that you grew up something about abo something i grew up already expecting to be so it didnt change me as much graduate school in physics no nope it depends if i workout really hard the night before bef the day the day before if workout pretty hard its bad but if i dont workout it i dont know just eh its hard i guess moderately  thank you yes its okay im probably like i am now normal i think not as not as happy about everything  but still pretty okay i can still function no maybe slightly sorry no yes yes i have changes in my thoughts um applying to grad school again its been awhile and slightly apprehensive happy that its looks good but apprehensive that it might not be good and things like that what do you mean by that in case i know this is a computer but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school i understand okay i agree no not really probably keep doing what youre doing even though im not that old believe it or not um twenty years ago i was probably fifteen no no yeah yeah it was fifteen um just keep doing what youre doing i think i i was very lucky and fortunate way it worked out if i worked if it was a little bit different i dont think itd worked out so well even though its not perfect now i think im doing really well personally thank you same here goodbye
sure uh okay i guess not bad not good so so denver colorado uh to pursue job opportunities uh about two years ago uh once or twice a year uh i really like the sunshine um all the opportunities all the different kinds of people lots of stuff to do that sort of thing uh i hate the traffic i wish the seasons were more distinct and that everything costs a lot of money here pretty easy hmm id say uh people are rude um not having enough money uh what else mm just a lot of things are frustrating i guess cough i guess it depends on  what im annoyed about like if its at another person or about something i did or just life in general uh if somebody like a person annoys me ill probably let them know theyre annoying me until they stop is that what youre talking about okay uh so so not not as good as id like to be uh a few days ago about getting paid for something i did on time uh pretty pissed off taken advantage of i like to go to the gym uh hang out with friends read write that sort of thing mm at times uh because sometimes i like to keep to myself and dont feel like showing a lot of outward emotion i have a degree in in liberal arts majored in political science no i work uh in sales hmm to own uh several of my own businesses and and have lots of money coming in from different streams i guess if thats a job uh i used to live in mexico city that was pretty memorable um lets see it was pretty different than anything ive ever experienced it was a lot of fun exposed to a lot of new things and new people  uh i was pretty young carefree good times um not recently but i have in my life traveled quite a bit um lets see i went to london that was a lot of fun pretty cool city little too expensive but definitely cool of what just anything in life um lets see uh boy thats a good question um moving to la was pretty memorable took me a lot of hard work to uh move here so that was memorable i would say sniffle clears throat hmm uh maybe like six months ago uh things were just going really well didnt have much stress in my life uh yeah im im easier more easily irritated and uh yell more tired more uh kind of down feeling down more not as productive uh yeah awhile ago uh hmm mm dont know exactly its been a few years but i still feel the same as i did when they diagnosed me so i assume im still depressed um well i just im a big believer in talking to people about your problems so i just thought that would uh be a good idea so i did it and and thats what i found out oh yeah definitely um i mean it depends on what you mean by therapy like i or most people probably cant afford good therapy but just even talking to friends i would consider therapy somebody who will listen so helps you get stuff off your chest  clears throat thanks um well i havent necessarily seen a therapist per se but uh when you talk to somebody who listens and you and you get stuff like out there like out of your head or whatever it its uh it helps to destress i think hmm pretty girls laughter  laughter um im a good leader im really smart uh being able to um survive on my own in a city like this completely on my own with no outside help  yeah lots of stuff um just dumb mistakes i made when i was younger that looking back now with what i know now i probably would not have made um i would tell myself to seek out and listen to people older than me as much as possible hmm scrubbedentry hes always good for a sort of pep talk but uh with a dose of reality he doesnt sugarcoat anything so talking to him always helps give me perspective um talented and i dont know good at stuff im good at a lot of stuff people seem to notice that i i guess nice good disposition funny see you later
yes quite well feel good los angeles california here mhm one of the few um native born los angelinos i uh home school my ten year old son and uh im a home maker i have five children and married twenty two years mhm so thats a full time job huh uh somewhat we can we went to israel about two months ago um for a pilgrimmage with our church yeah so i would say yes ive traveled a bit uh well most recently we like two months ago went to israel for a pilgrimmage we were gone about nine days and it was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in chorazine which is near the uh galilee and in a place called uh uh i mean the the name of the area is chorazine but uh we stayed in a place called adonis galilea which is a um a house for that welcomes um christian uh pilgrims as well as jewish pilgrims um i i enjoy like really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting the people and and of course seeing the the history i mean especially israel i mean its the  its totally ancient but um most most i enjoy is is the the people i think to uh get a better understanding of how different cultures um live no not at all just dont i you know all my life ive always been open and and uh willing to socialize and i remember my younger brother always um joking and saying that i i would talk to anybody and i will ill talk to just about anybody just because i enjoy learning about other people um most of the time like by the end of the day after ive cooked dinner and weve had dinner together as a family um i theres a word game on the computer that i like to play for a little while and then um watch tv have a cocktail with my husband and just relax thats what we do and you know cause we have a lot going on we dont stay up too late so i like to watch crime dramas um really mad probably not a lot um i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever so that that gets me angry but um in terms of like really um getting like heatedly angry i mean other than like little things that my children do to you know especially my oldest child whos twenty one you know he can be confrontational so other than that nothing gets me like really angry havent i havent havent felt that um contributing to society helping uh helping to raise um responsible people i guess um and of course the love and the affection and the um the fun and the excitement that goes with it of all the stages that go i mean like really right now im in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults so its really fun because were able to um talk about current events and all kinds of stuff thats going on in the world and you know have have uh challenging discussions and that sort of thing so its its a different level than when youre taking care of babies and you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff the hardest thing is that its twenty four seven um youre never not a parent you know its and so you have to accept that and thats i remember when i first with my first child um thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean theres no going back you you cannot um change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but i mean under normal circumstances you cant change um that and its a permanent thing and um it it it uh in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it give you a different sort of freedom mhm always im sorry i didnt get what you said um some of the things thatve been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church um and my faith uh but also my husband hes been a really um hes kind of hes very like logical thinking and very you know grounded so when if i get emotional or i get upset about something hes always we balance each other out likewise if hes upset about something im able to balance him out its been a thats been a a great gift in my life um i dont i i dont think id be categorized as somebody with a a temper um occasionally i i occasionally i get angry but i dont like have like rarely do i have outbursts um im more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up so with you know like my husband and i dont rarely fight like have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens because i i like i said im more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if im thinking something i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up um usually im arguing with my older son because he um you know he thinks he knows everything hes twenty one years old so he has the know it all mentality  and im just telling him that he doesnt know it all and you know as life goes on hell learn more hes very confident and very self uh self uh whats the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct and he still has a lot of learning to do thats all mhm it is it can be mhm i think um that many of them are um spoiled and live in an environment of uh of instant gratification um which i think is gonna be um detrimental to the to the future of this country but um you know given that with all the technology we have theres really not any way to go back so i i have um hope that um they will i mean i think this country was built on on uh hard work and and ethics and uh hopefully our our the next generation and the the generations after that can maintain that um that standard of living i dont know if its possible mm as loving nurturing um funny we laugh a lot and um caring honest things that uh i mean my best i have  well actually my best friend is its two people its two sisters that i grew up with and um we i for some years took care of their mother who has alzheimers before my parents got sick so i had a very close have a very close relationship with them still do and so um im considered the fourth sister so i would say that those are my best friends and and um we love each other very much its a good relationship no no yes most mostly mm minorly depression it was more anxiety um probably um um its probably been five or six years i mean ive had if off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with the anxiety but um other than that i i you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if its not under control um but now its under control so i have a great huh um no i think it was what they call free flee float free floating anxiety more of a of of uh organic um reason for it in other words there there was a chemical imbalance  in my brain ive been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great um we had a  good family gatherings a little stressed because um were making a big decision right now to help my parents out um my dad is really sick um and weve offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so were in the throws of that and um so thats a big big change but im looking forward to it because really dont want my parents to be alone as they get theyre in their eighties so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them um not easy usually all of my life i think ive always i mean im not ive always had um at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night um to go to the bathroom basically and uh other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning then i cant go back to sleep  ill get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep idepends on what my schedule is and if the kids are have to be at the school early and theres a lot of factors yeah sometimes it does mm probably basically the same i think i might complain a bit like oh im tired or my body hurts or whatever you know but um i think overall probably the same my kids know ill be ill tell me kids oh im really tired and theyll understand my older daughter will be really helpful they my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that so you know they may pitch in a little bit more uh not really not not no not really not anything significant huh um actually yes i do i do feel like therapy is useful um well uh we had a situation with my daughter um she also suffers from anxiety and um we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently were about to finish a group with her that was a six month um uh group for dbt its called and its like a  its the first time they its the first time theyre documenting using it with teenagers and um its been really good its been very helpful its just all about how to live in the moment and how to you know actual physical and mental um strategies to keep your uh keep you from your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or you know in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so um thats the focus of the therapy and its been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter and its been really um really informational and really helpful i think oh my daughter was um she was in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and we knew it and um we acted on it thats all um like really joyful and happy i would say probably when probably it would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the at the in knaan  uh so um you know where the wedding of kana took place that was really moving and beautiful um and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day flew to israel so it was right at the same time it was beautiful very meaningful and other than that i would say you know like uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dads birthday turned eighty three on christmas eve you know that kinda thing so um um thats an interesting question i would say um once i get like things done that i need to do like if im have a lot of chores ch a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once i get them done i feel like a sense of accomplishment you know much like i mean i worked for many years in a as an administrative manager at ucla and um you know once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or if theres a lot of different things you have to meet deadlines theres uh that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know so i think that would be you know for me the most um most recent um way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished dream job hm i think ive already lived it im also a birth doula and um yeah and um so ive attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends and um its the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in the birth the bringing of new life into this world so i would say thats probably was my was a dream job and i didnt know it i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and um was awesome it is and was awesome so i dont work at at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed but um i like i said i do it for family members um i attended a friend of mines birth by accident she uh she had had the same ob as i did with all my children and um i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends and her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didnt want me to leave i hadnt planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood um about fifteen years ago cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old so um yeah and ive been um well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the womans in labor but uh and you know also like for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent im not doing it for business and that way and because of that i dont have like back up doulas that in case im sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me so um but so far its been that all the women thatve asked me ive been able to be there for some reason so the um the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didnt even call me laughter  it was in the middle of the night she was like  two hours of labor she wouldnt even if she had called me i wouldnt have been there in time laughter so um it went really fast but other than that you know um yeah ive been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do um in all of life or in your job uh probably my my own birth i mean my the birth of my own children um like theres an extreme sense of joy excitement relief because of course youre out of the pain and then like its just its just a matter of you know going forward from there but its its like something you cant explain its its just its awesome after you give birth and i have experienced both ways ive done both um natural and my last child was via csection so ive had both both um experiences um i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasnt funny and um she she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water and oof my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because i only had like two contractions after that my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great cause i didnt have to go through any of the labor but um im sure they werent happy to fill out a lot of paper work after that so now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago um ten or twenty years ago i was probably more not as um relaxed not as um like i feel now at my age that um i i dont have the same concerns that i did then i dont worry about uh i dont worry at all about what people think about me i dont worry at all about what you know you know like my i noticed my daughters oh mom you cant wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i dont care you know but they do because its still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things what are you most proud of in your life most proud of um probably my family my my husband and my my children i mean the fact that weve stayed married that weve were an in tact family that um my kids see every day how their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and they um they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so i would say thats probably it um probably the one of my best qualities is uh being able to listen to people and being able to um not be judgmental um through the years ive had a  a lot of experience with um people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and its just taught me that um everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems and um i dont think im better than someone else if you think youre better than someone else then thats usually um to me a sign that you dont know yourself well enough okay okay goodbye
alright yes okay and you inglewood california yes no uh its okay um you mean my girlfriend and my daughter yes theyre theyre okay its okay its cool yes i do um well im a football recruiter so i travel uh all around the world to to sign different football players for our sports management company  uh um just the independence about it being alone being able to be free and not tied down to one to one thing you know its great i i remember traveling to uh scrubbedentry and take him to clubs and this and that and were not that type of organization laughter yeah um dishonesty i sigh i dont like when people are are dishonest um that really really really bothers me and not true not honest not real um that that upsets me a lot um i tend to just try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind usually take a walk or something like that or just just just go in a room by myself and just try to clear my head he my head   um im okay with it at times um uh but i can defintely be better oh um i argued argu argued with my my lady a couple days ago and it was about um our daughter and some of the things shes doing in school and she she wants to raise her one way and i think i wanna raise her kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situations so i think discipline disci discipline is a big key and the key is life and she she she was raised a little differently um i dont know just angry upset you know when youre in a argument thats what you feel so you do and say things that  that that bother you and you just you go on with it  um yeah uh a little bit sigh um i dont know it just sigh i eh just the way i feel i dont know i cant really say just the way i feel um a little a little um i dont know just um realness um honesty the truth just being straight out front um im pretty close um im pretty close with my family oh whole nother subject just theyre raised different um i i think society so societys gonna become even wilder with wi the way the kids are raised and no discipline and and the things theyre doing everything we we they live and everythings inflated so much to where um it its getting to a point where its getting out of hand i think kids these days to a certain extent are are are much wilder than i was and and generations before me and just able to do and say and the lack of respect and you know just educationwise its just i think its just tough times for kids and and the way they act uh its its its ridiculous to me um i definitely like to watch sports uh i i like to gamble i i like to travel i like to skate um i like kind of like uh a a a guy that likes to see different sights and go different places uh like different difft im a big movie person so i like going to theatres stuff like that um im actually living it um i i always wanted to be in in some kinda sports industry and thats what im doing now i just uh my goal was to get a little higher in the ladder and and own my own sports management company um but im doing pretty well for myself so i am happy yeah no no no um its okay id say its pretty easy irritated tired sigh i dont know its been awhile its been awhile couple weeks ago huh what did you say no not really um i think he would describe me as a stand up guy i try to be um um a good loyal friend and and an adult i think he would describe me like that  uh school went to school grew up together ive been knowing all my friends for pretty much all my life  yeah uh very close me our our uh my friends and i are very close uh um we pretty much do a lot together still at this age  uh im honest um im loyal very loyal um i am a hard worker i think i am um to a certain extent im just not the average guy im pretty much im a different different breed i just carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy  i dont know just how what i was raised and how uh my dad was kinda different uh and and and he didnt go with the in crowd and i think i learned that from him a lot and and its just it its its um kind of the same path i took um yes a lot of things i regret um i regret a lot of decisions in my life um yeah one um i actually let a a lady in my life go years ago that i thought was my soulmate and  we had a big argument and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then that that break i i started dating somebody else and i told her ima go my way and she go her way i think that was a big a bad decision a very bad decision yeah totally i think i couldve took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead of uh sigh being so upset and moving forward uh just upset um i tend to get upset and then my thoughts get clouded so uh mm i i need to think a little more when im upset uh i dont know just experience and time being you know making making up for your mistakes and and and and um being better about different decisions after you made the mistakes um sigh think a little harder about situations situatio uh about situations and and things and the decisions dec decisions that you make uh think a lot longer and harder before you make em and i think the outcome would been a little different today um my grandmother shes always been a um a a positive influence uh shes a great black woman um with a old school um ways of living so um i think i i ive added that to my life shes a great woman scrubbedentry in baseball and um yeah laughter um i was a pretty good player i was a pretty good athlete growing up um i was one of the top scrubbedentry and uh that started a future in in athletics and thats what i wanted to do so i

always want me to go to a black college but of course i didnt wanna do that laughter uh i went to illinois so theyre a very positive role model for me theres certain things that i dont do today because of them i dont drink i dont curse i dont look down on people who do but i dont have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things um  i love to drive i love to travel and my dad used to always take us some place every weekend he was off wed go somewhere cause we were in chicago indiana michigan some place in the area wed go up to michigan and pick fruit or we got all our dogs from uh puppy farms in indiana that kinda thing uh i had an uncle who lived in uh wisconsin who was a dairy farmer so my dad used to love to drive and i love to drive also  mm thats a hard one  ive had a lot of great experiences uh i think the best one was uh we went for my anniversary we went to europe we went to paris and uh  we rode the orient express we went from we didnt go all the way to istanbul we went from london to venice and then flew back to paris uh    that was probably the best experience ive ever had in my life i ive never really cared for europe because theres so much here in the united stated to do and so much in america and i had been to alaska and hawaii but we said wed do something different and wed always wanted to go on the orient express and we did that expensive but phenomenal trip gotta do it once its a once trip not once in a lifetime just once not traveling more sooner we did a lot when the kids were younger  but um there are a lot of things we shouldve probably done we didnt do i wish i had gone to chicago chica we would always go to chicago on thanksgiving but i think we shouldve gone more than just on thanksgiving my parents come here at around christmas time but i think we shouldve uh done a lot more when it comes to that  yes thats thats thats why its a regret because it couldve been avoided theres things we couldve done and we were spending our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and whats closest to us     i think that people peop most people oh yes very definitely  ooh  thats a good question ten or twenty years ago  i wouldve said um dont take things too seriously but dont be too relaxed over em either sometimes you can uh take things for granted never take anything for granted  nothings promised  oh heaven forbid  laughter no i have not laughter no no  no  very very easy i really have no problem with that once in awhile if i uh am anxious about something or have things coming up due or projects due then i get kind of uh anxious a little bit  i dont like to be late uh i dont like to make mistakes so therefore i i do have some anxiety issues which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure that i have everything right  tired  i dont get irritable i think i just uh lethargic maybe a little litt just a just a little bit  very good i was up late last night so im kinda tired now but i i usually have no problems sleeping  uh and i get a good nights sleep  mhm no i have not  um no not at all i just came back off a christmas break

yes um im fine this is a little bit strange you know talking to a virtual human um i was born i was born in la i was raised out in the suburbs um ive lived all over los angeles ive lived in the valley long beach and now im in culver city um theres great food here the weather is great most of the time theres a lot of sunshine it doesnt get cold i dont have to shovel snow there are lots of opportunities a lot of diversity all different sorts of people uh i think thats really great  that is a much longer list i would like to get out of here um the the traffic i think thats number one i think everybody hates the traffic and everybodys so busy all the time its really hard to to get together with anybody everybodys so devoted to their jobs and uh then were sitting in traffic a lot too  i just graduated actually um i studied marine biology i was i went to school and i orginally studied um graphic design and i found that kind of unfulfilling so i took a trip for a while traveled around the world and started scuba diving and i realized that i really loved marine biology so thats how i got into it  everybodys been asking me that a lot lately since i just graduated i think i would like to exhaling  um i think maybe managing a um managing a research you know im not im not really sure i think i would like to something in tropical marine ecology maybe like managing a preserve um something like that its a hard question to answer laughter i do um i like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world well i traveled for eight months in central america um and i visited a lot of different countries i um i went scuba diving i think um i think intolerance injustice in the world those are probably the things that get me the most fired up vent to my boyfriend does that count laughter im pretty good it takes it takes a lot to really get me um fired up to the point where i i kinda blow my top the very few people that have seen me angry um to the point where im kind of yelling and screaming angry um i dont know i just dont get there i think that im a little bit afraid of losing my temper so i keep it under control  laughter it was yesterday actually i argued with my boyfriend um about uh getting getting a job i was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no dont go take that job for six months cause i would miss you and he was just being supportive so um we kind of argued about that laughter and it was ridiculous so we i ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight um meditate excercise go out in nature just um unplug get myself away from the computer away from technology away from people  i would say not really um im an only child and its just me and my parents and were very very dissimilar for example um im a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are uh couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we dont have too much to talk about or things that we can really do um as far as shared activites so you know i love them and everything but theres not too much common ground yes i think im a very social introvert but i seem to find most social encounters to be draining where as my my boyfriend for example he um derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people for me its always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge  i not sure i have a best friend but um i guess ill say my boyfriend hes hes kinda my default best friend um he would probably say passionate intelligent um he always tells me that im really hard on myself which is true um dedicated loyal   i think im just proud of who i am xxx i dont know if thats the answer that most people give but i think that im im really proud of who i am i try really hard um ive done a lot of things in my life im a really good person i think its its kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself  a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so im im proud of that laughter no i have not no yes i was probably about fifteen at the time so i think eight was is that seventeen years ago  yes um i was cutting and my one of my best friends called um called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment i that wasnt the first time i had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but um before it was more they thought i had adhd so um it was more m i think my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help i havent for about three years uh i stopped because it felt like uh i was checking in with a parole officer i just wasnt enjoying the relationship i had but i still have the psychiatrist that i go to for med checks  laughter uh i do think its useful if you have the right therapist i think if you dont have a good relationship with your therapist it can be incredibly harmful i have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and wont ever go back lately ive been a little bit down um i should say a little bit more down than usual because i graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things twenty four seven has come to an end and without the routine its been a little bit  weird finding out what to do with my finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time its also been a little bit um depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesnt translate to real world skills and there arent that many jobs for marine biologists in california  almost impossible ever since i was a little kid i had a i had trouble falling asleep and um about four years ago it it became really really bad where i just couldnt sleep through the night i was getting about four hours of sleep  sometimes i would wake up every hour and id wake up in the morning just a complete wreck so for about four years ive been taking trazadone so i can sleep um have you ever seen fight club um youre a virtual human so you probably havent seen that but its its pretty much like that i im just um a complete panicked anxious wreck i i lose my ability to deal with um i lose my ability to deal with things im much more likely to lose my temper um i cant regulate my moods im just really volatile probably a few months ago i think that i may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgotten to take my medicine with me um or something like that and then i cant sleep and so thats what happens   uh makes sound with mouth really happy i mean um i dont know its easy for me easier for me to keep track of when i feel really really bad really happy i guess i felt happy on new years really happy on new years eve which was um uh ten days ago um i was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to palm spring and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them i dont get to see them very often um because ive been in school and ive been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to uh real life i think that im im kind im considerate im tolerant im pretty open minded im aware of my faults um i just i just try to be nice to everybody and im very curious about um about the world and things that i dont know about i really like to learn  uh off the top of my head first thing that came comes to mind is diving the blue whole in belize it was really amazing um it was me and my friends we just you know jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this uh limestone sink hole and its really really really blue and you just drop down to about a hundred and forty feet in something like two minutes we did it pretty quick not everybody could do it that quick and um as you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and theyre huge theyre larger than human and cause its this  cave system um and its really murky and theres sharks swimming all around you so  that was that was pretty good laughter  im trying to remember that at the moment i havent had much free time the last three and a half years being in school um laughter so uh i guess reading hiking um just being together with my friends doing um relatively low key things going to movies having dinner parties cooking playing with my cat not that i can really think of im sure ive made mistakes in my life but um you know im still here so cant be that bad hmm um i dont know hang in there um hold on to your clothes cause the nineties are coming back in fashion hmm um cloudy weather uh beautiful sunsets being in um being out in nature kind of being away from the hubub of the city getting a good grade laughter i think my boyfriend has hes just um especially the last year hes really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking hes  really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking hes made a lot of positive changes in his life and i know that those things arent arent hard or arent easy i should say um to t so to see someone overcome that  uh really inspired me

yes laughter  fine how are you uh watts california but now i live in west la  laughter yes i love uh the sunshine i love the palm trees i love that um youre thirty minutes away from everything its a great city   the traffic its terrible  i studied child development  yeah actually i uh teach children how to be safe in uh traffic situations  oh my dream job is to be a filmmaker thats what i wanna do i wanna die doing that job making movies  well when i was uh in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film uh because i wasnt getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making film laughter  last time i made a film just this last october made a short film  laughter its about three people that connect together theyre completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally thanks laughter  really mad uh  laughter really mad i you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesnt pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences thats what makes me mad  yeah  laughter yeah yeah it sucks shes one of the smartest kids in her school  no its its its very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find are negative go to them and its like youre fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know times a hundred and its just difficult to deal with that but um other than that it its okay but its being a parent is never easy   sigh  the hardest thing about being a parent  i would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they dont make mistakes or so that they dont get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they dont so it gets very uh  um annoying sometimes that you know whats coming and you give them the info and they dont wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt its its sad and then they wanna come to you and youre like ugh i tried to tell you but you cant be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so    mm yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles its hard to watch but its a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn cause once they get it they got it so however they get it you as a parent youre happy they got it  sigh all the love the children bestow upon you its great they  yeah they love lo you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me im doing a great job when im like laughter what does she know about a great job shes only seven but you know they have that unconditional love and you just cant help but feel like a good person for having the children tell you that youre a good person so i like that  hmm oh laughter my god theyre ooh sigh theyre you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity and theres so much technology out there kids are learning so fast its almost like theyre already little adults but theyre missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they dont know what to do with all this information and they just have to fight through all that info and they the its not organic anymore children growing up these days its not organic its sped up its pushed and its just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so thats whats wrong hmm me laughter just sharp inhale breathe in sharp exhale and breathe out or ill just walk away from the situation  argued  i argued with my fiancee uh a couple months ago about gosh i forgot i i forgot i dont remember  it was petty yeah but it didnt last long cause shes like me she doesnt like to argue about stuff we like to take care of stuff as it happens and thats it hmm my fiancee laughter well um well i mean we met um when i was working at at a charter ch not a charter school but at a recreational center we met there and uh we talked we hit it off uh we didnt see each other for an entire year and then uh we reconnected and we went on a date and it was great ever since my family were pretty close my brother lives in colorado my sister lives in oklahoma i have a dad that lives in a neighboring city where i am um as close as we can be with the distance and certain choices that my family have made over the years you know being far away and um but my immediate family like you know my fiancee and my daughter like were close and its great laughter i dont travel enough but i have traveled a couple of times uh within the last five years i just came back from new zealand so that was a great experience  yeah  i enjoy meeting new people thats the biggest thing about traveling i like seeing new things i like just immersing myself in different cultures and situations and i like just being away from it all thats thats good too well i went to new zealand uh not too long ago and i had ha stayed there for a week um i learned about celsius cause you know here we have fahrenheit and that was fun uh i learned how to play cricket   uh i

pretty hard and im very slow to getting upset about things  no  no no mm its fairly easy  laughter uh i guess i get pretty moody you know i could be a little little snappy at people when i dont sleep

definitely wanna get into acting and really work it and get some really good roles so hes been a positive influence he stayed out of trouble um hes maintained a good working relationship with people and hes always positive and very super helpful and very encouraging      oh we went to junior high school and high school together so hes my best friend  yeah  laughter yes it is  wow theres so many uh  scrubbedentry had uh these bag of m and ms and we had went to a play and there were two girls that were a couple of rows down that you know we didnt particularly care for but you know thats how kids are you just they dont know how to you know they say they dont like somebody but you know anyway but we got these m and ms and while the it was dark we start throwing m and ms and hitting em in the head with the m and ms and then we came to school like three days later uh we were summoned and there was a mock trial to get scrubbedentry so we were able to get ourselves off on like the entire group had found us not guilty of the crime and but then we got in trouble anyway because our teacher just wouldnt allow us to not get in trouble so we had to clean up the yard for like two days  oh man you name it uh i love scuba diving ive only done it twice but i love it wanna get back into it like traveling uh i love exercising i actually like working out now uh i used to think it was a chore but now im really really getting into it that i love watching movies you put me in front of a good movie and im a happy camper so thats about it hanging out with family  anything i regret hmm deep breath you know what i think i laughter i probably regret not going up to will smith when i had the chance  yeah uh will smith was coming up the street and i saw him and i got so nervous i jumped in the bushes and i didnt meet him uh my boss at the time thought it was really funny but i just i wasnt ready to meet him yet so but i think i regret meeting him   advice i would give myself ten or twenty years ago i would probably say that when my gut told me to do something i shouldve just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and analyze it you know days weeks months later if i feel it in my gut i should go for it so go with my gut more  really happy  hmm really happy i i had a film festival that i was putting together and things were so intense we things were going wrong but then things were going right but then once the people came and packed the house i was really happy that we had a packed house at this uh film festival so this was about a month ago  yeah  sigh lets see i think right now at this point im most proud of putting a short film together with a minimal budget but it has amazing actors it has a great storyline and i didnt think it could be done but its done or close to being done and im im proud of that i was able to get it done i think i could walk away happy knowing that i gave it a really good shot and i think this movie is probably going to take me and the rest of my film crew buddies to higher heights oh really  alright well what was your name again  ah ellie  goodbye

thats pretty much it laughter  um the people here tend to be a little more rude and um its just always a fast pace  well when i moved here i was twenty five so it was a lot more fun because when youre young in the city you can have a lot of fun    and then i got into the real estate and did really well for a while and then the market crashed and so now im old and im not making any money so times are tough  no no im much mu much of more m more of an extrovert  um when i dont get what i want laughter and um  rude people  and um  just inconsiderate people  im pretty good um at controlling my temper when im not uh like if i if i drink alcohol itll make my temper go worse but uh ss noise when i dont drink im pretty good at controlling my temper   uh the last time i argued with somebody was  somebody that owed me money  uh i live uh in west hollywood  no no no i live alone i have a dog its good i mean i dont like my neighbors i hate my neighbors but the ones upstairs just moved out so thats good news hopefully the ones that move in are not that noisy and the ones below i just cant stand because they argue with me   huh why because they cause my hardwood floors they say that eh ive been there for ten years and they still argue about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors  yeah  what was the question  my mother has been a very positive influence shes always kept me on track she lived with me for the last ten years until she recently moved to rhode island to live with my brother very close to my mother um not so close with my brother mm were close but were not like close close um so i mean we love each other we just dont really understand each other all the time  outgoing um life of the party  ambitious um  and sometimes cutthroat  um psh psh what am i most proud of  being always able to get through the things i need to get through to get to where i wanna be im generous im loyal uh im friendly im accommodating and um  thats about it  no yes  uh about four years ago  um i well i had ha i was beaten up and i had uh identity theft and uh you know i was just afraid to go out so i needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving um and just depressed all the time i i said i have to get out and start talking to people and so i did    thank you  um okay im panicky about the job situation  um you know cause my bills are pretty high and i dont really have a steady income right now  so uh thats whats worrying me the most is my uh financial situation  yeah  um  yeah i mean  well basically its like um i just recently quit drinking all together so i dont drink anymore so im noticing  yeah i mean its good cause of number one i dont have the money and number two i dont like the way i act when i drink   um so so thats a positive thing but well the when i was drinking it helped me just forget and numb myself now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good cause i can talk my way through them so i guess im evolving  uh yeah a long time ago um you know ive taken many medications here and there and um they really some of em would numb me some of them would  make me feel hyper so ive recently decided to t in the last six months three to six months just to not take anything so i dont take anything i barely even take an aspirin  just to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state   um not really  always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in car accident what happens if i cant pay my mortgage what happens if i eh eh just so many things i worry about and thats what was making me depressed i do at some point ive had some good therapists and ive had some bad therapists  um i tend to like the ones that talk back to me and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen   and then they just say okay your times up so and just prescribe me medication so i think id be better with a psychiatrist psychia psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist um well im not going to therapy now but  the therapy that i had before um  was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better  um i just i wasnt getting the right therapists recently so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking cause its a depressant so  mm you know stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself you know  um  i cant really think of anything right now  um  its been a long time i cant really think about a time when i felt really happy  thank you sniffle um  okay when i was a kid um  i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it  so then a little while later my father  came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car theres two packages in the car so go get them  so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car whats that   oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so thats one of my memorable esperiences   yeah cause im an animal lover so  um just the way that ive treated people before when i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when wh ever since i stopped the drinking i dont do that anymore so  so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that ive let that go uh cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasnt doing it to be sociable  get in a career that is really stable  like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney something that you know or in advertising i shouldve gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money dont go spend it on extravagant things  um when i have a job when i when im able to work  uh when im helping other people  uh when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood  okay thank you  youre welcome thank you  bye

yes very well  new york  just turn the volume up a little bit  laughter uh for a change yeah its good  i wanted wa i wanted to i wanted to see what los angeles was about  um probably took a year or two  uh you know being away from my family being away from what i was used to in new york the neighborhoods the people and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here uh the weather  you cant beat the weather its generally always nice its not too hot its not too cold uh its creative i do like uh you know movies  uh like the beach  the traffic its a lot of traffic uh  some of the sometimes i think people are a little bit colder here than and more distant and unfriendly than other places  i was a history major  no uh i do uh demonstrations in really rea uh highend supermarkets uh to be a screenwriter  thats one of the reasons why i came to los angeles  um its hard cause i dont always maintain uh focus and motivation i let other things distract me laughter  uh i was uh ive always been interested in films ever since i was a child and i was just always you know was writing and had an active imagination   uh ive in the last probably almost ten years ive traveled more than i had in the past pa well ive always traveled even as a kid my parents would travel around so yes seeing new places and seeing uh people that are different than i am seeing how they live  and taking in the sights  uh i went to kenya that was probably one of the best trips i ever went on um on the safari and   just going out in a jeep and seeing laughter wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible   oh yeah thats one the great experiences of my life and i also got to uh  a a place in egypt uh at the end of that trip um called uh  sharm el sheikh which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world which is hard to believe that egypt would but it was just amazing i went we i didnt go scuba diving i went uh snorkeling  what do i do to relax uh i i do i like to listen to music i like to uh helping watching movies helps me relax cause it takes me out of you know whatever might be on my mind i do meditate every day um i like to take walks in nature thats always calming especially down by the uh the ocean  uh what i it depends laughter sometimes i get angry and lose my temper uh a lot of times uh  ill do like a form of selfhypnosis and calm myself which is something ive recently learned how to do  which is very helpful  and also since i meditate it doesnt i dont get annoyed at things as easily as i did in the past some things that makes me really mad  i guess uh think of injustice  in the world or done to people when uh it doesnt really need to be that way that we could all get along  um  and and make the world better laughter uh last night i went to a movie screening  of a independent film and i didnt think it was done very well its not so much that we had a fun argument  about uh about the movie  so that was like you know that just happened yesterday so that was thats on my mind  laughter is there anything i regret yeah theres there are have been opportunities in my life that i wished i had uh taken them and pursued them  uh certain jobs you know when i first got to los angeles i had an opportunity to uh  become a grip and uh and i i probably shouldve pursued that  how did i decide it to do that i dont really understand the questions take advantage of every opportunity that came my way  to always alway i think saying yes  uh to any opportunity is is very important and no matter   how you feel you know you have to be confident that youll be able to achieve what you wanna do  no no no but ive been depressed in my life  uh for the most part ive ive been feeling good sometimes uh i feel a little blue uh i think you know sometimes if i if i allow allo allow a regret to come into my mind that can bring me down but i can you know usually get out if it pretty quickly  uh sometimes financial concerns sometimes uh  an an opportunity um how do i explain it eh there  sometimes so sometimes someti eh financial is one way i that i if i had made another decision i might have more money or my life would be different  um  not really i mean i i feel  pretty much the same what got me to seek help for laughter lets come back to that  um ive well okay well it generally talking to someone has helped when i did do that  uh pretty easy i dont have a problem sleeping  uh  usually im grumpy laughter so if i dont sleep well uh you know i feel tired and irritable   uh  how would my best friend describe me thats a good question um friendly f well im friendly f im definitely friendly and outgoing uh little bit secretive um i would probably that i should be theyd like to see me more accomplished and uh and uh attaining my goals and happier ha maybe a little happier   i think um  it it its tough it depends sometimes im very introverted cause i do like to write so that takes it means that i have to spend time alone and then when i come out of that uh im extroverted so i dont really see myself with as one hard way or the other it all depends on my on the situation and my mood  my best qualities um i think im caring i think im intelligent  uh i think im funny im outgoing um i have a likeable personality  you know people have said that  um im engaging but not uh oppressive or overly engaging theres a sort of a cool detachment  um and creative intuitive  laughter yes laughter  last time i felt really happy  i dont know i woke up this morning i was pretty happy  i had breakfast i was happy  sun was shining  laughter  um  i think that like i said going to kenya  was a memorable experience i do remember remem scuba uh snorkeling was a really great experience ex experience i just remembered you know seeing all the colors in the ocean  you know and feeling the sun powerful sun on my back  um almost beyond you know because beca almost beyond like   human in a way just more in touch with like everything the universe yeah it would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day but  what am i most proud of in my life  i think ive uh helped pft people  uh and sometimes when they were in crisis um you know ive written some screenplays scr screenplays um  ive had some good relationships  um good relationships just you know being connected with someone else you know  spending time with them and connecting  on emotional and  laughter physical and  mental levels  um what it could be a song that i hear on the radio uh it could be uh lot of times looking forward to something you know if im gonna go to a movie go bowling hang out with people um you know looking at work and and going to work and feeling productive can put me in it puts me in a good mood youre welcome bye bye
okay yes pretty good a little tired seattle washington uh when i was eighteen my mom and dad decided we wanted to move to california and uh so we moved down to pasadena uh actually monrovia first and ive been here ever since  yeah i did about two years ago i went up for work and a look around the area pretty easy actually i do adapt the warm weather not having rain nine months of the year um people mainly the uh the area how big it is the traffic when i first got here the smog thats better now no when i was younger i was but i got outta that with work i did sure when i became when i my mom died and i needed work i went for a job that was called petitioning and uh you have to go in front of stores and talk to people about signing petitions and you do that after awhile you dont get shy about talking to anybody also when i was in school i took public speaking and i learned that really liked it more than i thought i would so i so i did the census job i actually got up in front of groups of people and talked to them and showed them how to take the test and i enjoyed it right now im working on getting all my licenses for selling insurance um and im gonna start work uh trying to get money from people to uh help kids in the uh in the world well the on the uh job helping kids was also a paid job i needed a paid job the uh one for insurance was i was getting older and i needed work that was steady and thats something i can do till im eighty five or ninety or whatever  laughter to be an artist well ive been good with art i like drawing painting et cetera but i didnt know if i could ever make a living in it so i never really got into it and every time i tried it seemed i never got anywhere  so maybe when i get like eighty or ninety maybe ill go into ceramics or something and do that as a profession no unfortuantely i dont thats okay im not my mom and dad are die are dead i have no brothers or sisters and the rest of my family have either moved away or i dont talk to them anymore or like that  well i have kind of an attitude that if i have me and friends i have then im okay uh read uh watch sports when theyre available uh lets see i used to play golf i may do that again some day but not right now because of the cost and the time people that are rude well usually i ignore it this morning actually i told a guy to stop what he was doing and we got kind of an argument about it and then the argument was over and it was done   very good because i had a very bad temper when i was a kid and i told myself i had to control it uh this morning about the guy making lots and lots of noise uh on purpose and uh in a place that was just not the place to do it i mean it was a public place but uh and that was it just a little argument and im done with the argument once i say what i say laughter yes not right now that i can think of uh like read um if i can travel i travel uh i dont travel long distances but even going out to riverside is kind of an adventure for me seeing things on the way and back talking to people maybe well a number of years ago i went drove back east to uh massachusetts to do work back there on the way back i took a greyhound bus all the way back from washington dc all the way back to california   uh into washington first and then down from there and uh worked in massachusettes for about oh uh six months to eight months  enjoyed the area quite a bit but didnt want to be there when the snow came and uh enjoyed coming back on the bus had people near next to me almost all the way different people and had a lot of fun yeah yeah i was in the airforce and uh when i was eighteen nineteen sixty five during the vietnam war no i was in great falls montana it it really didnt years later i probably uh learned more from the fact that i got out early and maybe i should have stayed in and stuck with it but i tended to quit things when i was younger and so now that and other things i decided never to quit anything i came down here uh played pool for a number of years uh finally graduated from high school which i had dropped out of when i moved uh went on to college got my bachelors degree and an aa degree at pasadena and cal state la and started working various jobs and uh thats about it took care of my mom uh business that was my major i also studied cyclic anthropology and philosphy and history et cetera no no never depressed de lately not so good between the fact that i sleep in my car and its very cold and then sometimes i do get uh and with all the things going on in my life right now i i think of things and so and plus i get up at four thirty in the morning   thats okay uh tired and i get a little grumpy sometimes but not very much tired with all the things ive had to do and uh weather and sleep no uh a little bit sometimes about how maybe i shouldve started doing all this years ago i just go on i tell myself to basically stop it and to uh go on doing what things to uh improve myself not very anymore it took me years to study that to do that i dont know if you call it zen or not but uh couple months ago when i passed all my tests and uh medicare medi uh medicare advantage and passed everyone of em for every company that sent em to me i stick to everything i do now im persistent  i dont let things get out of hand before i do something about it i used to be uh whats the word i put off things i dont do that anymore and uh i treat people nicely always until given a reason not to and i dont talk about my bad stuff to anybody usually laughter not very because the same thing ive trained myself over the years to not talk about myself i talk to other people i talk about them uh lets see my mother gandy um bertrand russell lets see im not sure who else other people ive had but i dont remember their names or they were teachers et cetera earlier in life uh like i said uh stopping everything not completing things i regret very much uh yeah i coulda done better probably the advice i gave myself to get off my butt and go learn and get an education uh and get on with my life do something  that ive survived well im sixty five ive been sleeping in my car for a number of years i went from sleeping on pavement to where i got a car  while ive done that ive improved my credit rating ive gotten uh a number of jobs that ive been very happy with  ive had a lot of friends both homeless ho people that are homeless and not homeless and uh im in pretty good health and where as other people in my family have died young so i guess thats about it uh good jokes uh people having a happy time going and having a drink with somebody on occasional basis uh about eight months ago was the last time when i had a beer with someone lets see probably uh getting within one foot of a live wild deer it was in uh green lake in washington and i uh was out behind our house and this wild buck deer was walking in the field and i started motioning to it and it came within about one foot of me and the only reason it left my dad drove down the drive way and it made noise and the deer ran off i was within petting difference distance of him and i wasnt to sure if shouldve petted him or not but i was about to laughter as you bye
yes im okay  uh im from here originally los angeles  mhm um i like the weather  and my familys here which is why im here i moved away for a while uh i like that theres a lot of culture cult even though everyone says theres not culture in la there is a lot of culture theres theater and film and lots of museums and things like that all different kinds of people i like the diversity    mhm um  well i dont like that i had to move back kind of against my will laughter so starting a new career uh starting over in my career it so thats not really something uh well i moved back cause my dad was sick  so thank you  thank you so thats why im here but it also means i live with my dad and my brother who are like hoarders and ridiculous so  uh acting theater it was mhm yeah  yeah i am   im an actor i uh right now im doing a a theater show and auditioning and taking some classes and  that sort of thing  um well my parents are both artsy people and i grew up around it and for a long time i was singing and then uh i was went to study musical theater and somewhere along the lines i realized that acting was more my bag than singing i suppose but i still do both  mhm no i dont  uh i dont usually have trouble talking to people uh im pretty friendly i can get along with most people people usually tell me their secrets within five minutes of meeting me which i feel is a mark of an extrovert laughter    laughter um  i take a bath or read a book uh go out with my friends go to the theater uh eh sometimes my work is very relaxing so sometimes just like singing a song or any of that going for a walk  mhm yoga things that make me mad um  injustice laughter i can be very righteously indignant i suppose um  people who dont see those things and people whove who have a like entitlement i think entitlement and sense of privilege that can make me mad  yeah  uh  it depends i usually usual a lot of times its i argue my case laughter i guess laughter um or i i call my best friend usually and complain talk to her about it  pretty good pretty good i dont have too much of a temper  um like a real argument or like a debate  laughter um if was a real argument it probably would be my exboyfriend and we just argued about why we broke up stupid things like that  eh i think i was kind of over it by then but  it was at times  laughter  um  the last time i felt really happy  was like really happy probably hanging out hanging out with friends the other night i had a good time uh scrubbedentry it is its nice its nice my best friend would describe me as an open book she often makes fun of me for like just telling everyone everything um she would describe me as   uh compassionate and uh having a a strong sense of who i am  i think yeah she also she would describe me as not having like a good sense of social norms sometimes probably thats something that she  makes fun of me for um because i do just like tell everyone everything and dont realize that i have like holes in my clothes and things like that but nothing nothing bad we have a very good relationship hmm yeah yeah it has laughter not terrible trouble but but yeah its gotten me in trouble before sure  no i havent  no but i think i had it  but i never went to a doctor  um cause i had a i had a traumatic situation uh where somebody injured me and i i feel fe when i looked up ptsd later i realized reali i felt like i had all of the symptoms of like going back into situations like that i would get panicky and um it was very     uh i held on to it for a really really long time i think um i think that i did have it but i just i dont know cause i never i never saw anyone about it   um  sometimes yeah uh certain physical things with that part of my body can be a trigger or um it happened in a in an acting class so sometimes certain teachers if they criticize in a certain way i start to i start to panic even if theyre totally right and i know theyre right and like its something that someone else could tell me and id be fine with it eh sometimes itll make me a little upset or panicky yeah  no well i mean my dad is sick so not great  but um but considering not terrible  um ive been having bad dreams  uh  uh just like stress dreams i think having to do with my dad   um  like getting kidnapped or my teeth falling out things that if you looked them up always say like theres something out of your control which is like exactly what it is so      its not the best but its just dreams at least so   which way  okay  easy very easy  i am tired and maybe somewhat irritable goofy i get really goofy yeah  um i am fairly nonjudgmental  of other people i i i stay openminded uh i can make most people laugh im funny uh creative  um i yeah those are some of the best ones id say   yeah  i love meeting new people and seeing new things and learning uh and just getting out of the routine i like staying in hotels uh i like most things about traveling i even i even like flying i like all of it well i just finished a tour a couple months ago um going up and down the east coast and then across the us and uh performing for kids all over   yeah and then we ended here in la  yeah yeah it was great it was a good time  yeah um  lemmi think we  we went to  the hot springs the naturally occuring hot springs in colorado and that was really nice that was a nice way to unwind yeah  a lot of people i i would say um i mean my dad comes to mind certainly uh my godmother is a huge positive influence in my life as well   uh my best friend my best friend from high school i think i uh some so a few of my best friends from high school um and college that ive kinda grown up with and become who i am with them yeah  mhm uh small things sure  yeah uh i regret  the way that i dealt with a friendship that was ending once uh i regret  committing to certain people that ive dated  uh  but nothing huge i i tend to go well i wont do that again but i dont spend a lot of time like being upset about things ive done in the past  hmm stand up for yourself  um  laughter dont date felons laughter uh i think that i i dont have any trouble standing up for things that i believe in but sometimes i have trouble standing up for myself i think i i really internalize the idea of like you know women being too needy or uh or um i dont know those kinds of things and then xxx and so as as an adolescent and growing up i felt like well you then you just shouldnt need anything or youre needy and it took me a while to be able to like voice what i want what i needed from other people and be okay with

hello sure good a little tired indianapolis indiana  uh im a singer i like singing  um diversity my girlfriends uh from taiwan so its dealing with different cultures  the traffic the uh crazy people its um  seems hard to get anything really accomplished laughter it took me about six months just to figure out the directions twenty eight years ago a long time havent been there in about eight or ten years well uh i dont like my brothers so i dont want to hang around them i started my girlfriend uh we did about uh just went back got back from orlando and uh she likes to travel so meeting new people seeing new places uh helps me to get out of la and get a different perspective uh i just did the avatar seminar which is like a raise your consciousness and um cleaned out the crap in your head  laughter um yeah i feel better uh been having a lot of psychic attack and its uh im psychic so its very hard to deal with it  laughter um well um theres more to life than what you see so um a lot of things are in other dimensions and other places so have to deal with not only the emotions but people uh direct energy at you um well have to do a lot of clearing and grounding and stay true to yourself i am both well im introverted because i like to spend time by myself and im extroverted cause i like to meet new people uh used to be totally an introvert  watch movies watch tv read uh do crosswords im a singer sing write music im writing a novel um its sort of like the matrix um well i wrote the first twenty pages pretty quick so um uh now im expanding it i get inspiration uh it was actually a dream and then i wrote down the dream and now its becoming uh i could probably turn it into a movie laughter yeah uh when people dont respect me thats the number one no i just that my brothers they dont respect me they dont really um you know i want to love my family and but i dont want to hang around my brothers so its a conflict exactly pretty good i only get mad about once a year um my girlfriend about two or three months ago she was wanting me to do something and i said no yawn and i dont know yeah shes my girlfriend i know her for about a year now pretty close um one time i was singing and scrubbedentry and i was singing to an audience and that was great um well im looking into ways to expand my consciousness so that i can have more money and more abundance in my life so i can uh have my own house and uh live in my own creative space  sniffle uh singing im a singer so lets see like unforgettable so uh thats what i like to do no no no oh thats the hard part i uh i dont  i dont know maybe its because when i was uh a kid my brothers beat me up and i dont feel totally rested in myself or in my life so uh i feel like uh sniffle i dont feel totally safe yeah um a little irritable but i have been sleeping better since i met my girlfriend so its not totally bad my what behavior what i dont know um well i feel more positive i did the seminar and uh so that let me get rid of some crap in my brain sniffle and be more positive about life um well did a lot of exercises to uh reduce my stress and lot of my stress comes from uh judging myself and other people  yeah you could say that laughter uh well sniffle mm mm i dont know its hard yawn hard to deal with sometimes i mean sometimes a lot much too critical for my own good uh sniffle  well watching tv gets up but yawn uh lately i just been feeling like i need to um have less judgement and more fun  uh well i did that seminar um it was about a week ago i think  uh well i went to that seminar i got there i was able to take off work and yawn sniffle be in a different environment cause my job is stressful and sniffle my life is stressful so uh sniffle i was able to take a break which is great uh id say im outgoing fun smart uh but i mean in la people in la they dont want to most of them dont want to spend time with you i dont know if thats because of me or la laughter uh that i spend a lot of my time worrying and criticizing myself instead of moving forward avoid it yeah watching tv or going to see movies or sniffle trying not to think of it but it doesnt solve the problem uh well a little bit i havent paid my bills a lot i still owe money sniffle so um its kind of a selfdefeating prophecy proph prophecy  uh stop criticizing and start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen  uh my girlfriends been really helpful yawn well shes funny and sniffle she loves me and cares about abo about me and  uh laughter yeah um singer and im intelligent and creative and multidimensional and uh im a good listener  uh well ive written about four or five books i uh my voice i think would be number one cause when i started i didnt have much of a singing voice but now i do okay bye bye
yeah im doing okay how are you doing im originally from like a suburb su a suburb of la from the san gabriel valley i like the diversity i like the vibe of the city ive lived other places and its just not as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here so i just like la like all the things that are so close together then theres a lot of interesting things that totally different parts of the city just miles away from each other uh dont like the traffic dont like all the cars but i can live with it i mean theres not that much i dont like i studied music um vocal performance i studied music technology things like that yes right now um i sing in an opera company but my i do have a day job because it doesnt pay that much unless youre actually working for the la opera so i do have a day job i work at a call center that caters mostly to performers and actors and things like that and its really good because if i get a call i can call in and change my shift very easily so its actually a pretty good gig and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know its do some recording some live sound stuff but im kinda wanna get away from that do some video work sometimes but again i wanna get away from that i wanna go back to the  because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew laughter so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people but if im at home you know id kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family   dont really have too many close friends clears throat but yeah you know id rather keep to myself uh moderately close to the family that i have left ive actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so but like thank you laughter but like uh my im close to my husband and you know ive got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but its not like were interacting every day close together  but its somewhat close mostly i sing or i read or i write or just hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesnt work but i try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in and sometimes ss sometimes that works sometimes it doesnt but mostly creating things um contacting my family some so you know through facebook or whatever works but mostly in my free time i create things id like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um i mean my idea of like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip and i like to travel more um i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i dont get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel seeing see uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change  i like just seeing whats out there seeing and i know that theres a bigger world outside of  where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world laughter laughter clears throat um lets see xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line um my cousin and i would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway youre either in another state or youre at the end of the highway so wed take those wed just   sort of impromptu with like li a day or two notice just move things around just take off so those are actually trips that i i like making mak cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight just small short trips that arent very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas  so close to home but not but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that cause i dont really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but thats just little things that kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean cause theres sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you dont get driving a freeway so i i like i like doing that the last time that happened was may of last year thats the last time i was able to do that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin whos ten years younger than i am and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas and looked around and came back cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didnt like it so they kinda i showed show showed them some of the locals sites around there and we came back and was you know an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time laughter so it was kind of an interesting uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who cant fight back and theyre mean to them just because they cant fight back   and i actually like to see people who are strong st as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you so i think thats one thing thats makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason you know not people pe for people who cant fight back or for people whove done nothing to deserve it just that kinda really just makes me mad when im annoyed ill try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then ill wind up lashing out somehow either   you know verbally just cutting em with a quip or you know i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody but ill try to you know if ill try to walk away and defuse it if that doesnt work then ill let them know that theyre annoying me and get away from me laughter that usually works  not in like legal trouble or anything because usually ill find a way to get them to leave me alone um so theres not really like big trouble but cause i think cause its it it is offputting and its not expected exp the expected reaction and thats actually kind of cultivated in me that its not the expected reaction cause i know that will work and get people away from me so its not really in trouble and if  its is trouble its usually trouble that its from their the other persons perspective and it doesnt affect me at all because its usually a situation i can get out of  so as long as they leave me alone you know i dont i ill walk away from it uh the last time i argued with somebody like person per like a person per like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my uh the last thing i can think of was i argued with my husband about the care of my motherinlaw cause shes got dementia and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her cause she wont go anywhere but la i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the were that in our nature but we also know its cheaper to live elsewhere laughter but um so we came out here to take care of her  and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is cause she cant see that theres inherent danger now because of the disease process  but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants cause hes a mamas boy like i am im a mamas girl even though ive lost my mom like four years ago im still a mamas girl and ill still st and i still and i know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and thats what they want so you wanna get it for em and because you know they you know that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it  and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it but its kinda dangerous for her you know and i dont want things thi something to happen to her yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves cause its not that bad but its getting where she really shouldnt shou has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has ha she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that so i mean its a partnership its a its a dual effort its very much a dual effort but i would like her to move in with us so that was thats like a source of its not really like yelling screaming argument but lively discussion laughter you know than debate meh its not insurmountable i mean lifes not gonna be easy ever and if it is thats when you should worry because thats when somebody can pull the rug out from under you so as long as youre on top of things and youre present in your life its not gonna be easy but you deal with it and you you move on uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it so i mean i think i have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperment laughter to myself but they but they helped me see that its just in me and its not something i cant get over and that you know lifes gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when youre forty youre forty whether youre working at mcdonalds or doing what you want with your life and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how ive lived my life since shes passed   i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mothers life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didnt take care of that when she was the last year of her life cause i was too busy wanting to get her home my focus was to get her home so i didnt eat right i didnt take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year eating just horrible foods when i did eat so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick  and im wondering well if i didnt if i wouldve taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision vi my vision and my thoughts werent completely complete werent clouded would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed em and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she  uh wound up having a health catastrophe cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that so she wound up having sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke and it just kinda went down from there so im thinking well if i didnt if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her and i know there wasnt anything i wouldve been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her if i would have taken care of myself and thats like one huge regret that i have oh i know i am laughter but xxx its my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i cant really direct them into my own vision because theyre their own individual beings and they cant you know be what i want them to be and i know theyre not going to be but i still have you know my ideals and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too  fit into my life in a way in the best way possible but i know cause theyre other beings and i know im not gonna be able to do that for them and theyre not gonna be able to do that for me but its still my ideals laughter so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and whats their thei is it their decision or mine and its usually its theirs and i know its theirs so i so if you really care about somebody youre just gonna support them and go with them but  its still kinda hard laughter for for me and know i gotta get over it um ten or twenty years ago probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college laughter and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her and i think i wouldve been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside  the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years so i think i i probably wouldve done that um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of of yourself thats probably what i wouldve and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself thats probably the advance advice of what i would give myself    ten years ago laughter no no no but probably cause i havent gone to a doctor about it laughter cause i dont wanna know and i mean its not i know thereve been times in my life where ive been severely depressed and its usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it but id rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment and of it gets ge um after my mother had died i mean itd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didnt know if i if i was to blame for that its like logically i knew i wasnt but how could i convince myself of that um two weeks after she died i wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because i didnt take care of myself for a year and i figured oh im thirty years old if you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no laughter turns out no laughter but um i mean i wound up having to take more medication because of that uh its been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression cause so much of my life was based on being my mothers daughter all of a sudden i didnt its like the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didnt want anything anymore  so and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now and it its been a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldnt get up just stay in bed and sleep all day you know but then realizing that when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well they dont have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies i took that responsibility of doing it for them so that was one motivating factor was that they didnt have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldnt they didnt you know so they eh they actually got me up and and made me go out and face things even though i didnt want to didnt just didnt just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that wouldve been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them if i wasnt there to take care of them they wouldve been you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably  and maybe they wouldve not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for  for me i mean for me making selfish decisions   so its like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed laughter so s and thats actually been a motivating factor is to to cause ive figured out that if it was just me id be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldnt be a big deal i wouldnt care   as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but i have a family to look after now  so i have to go out and do things  you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know   but im trying to strike a balance between the two because its what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so im   been working on on a balance of the two very laughter but its worth it i mean  it would be very id have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it laughter  but keeping a residence down paying bills things like that  its its difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything anyth if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that  and i and and i know that  but  it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up  but then  its like well whats the alternative  i mean i dont think i could live a comfortable life  cause if i did i wouldnt do anything laughter i have to be slightly uncomfortable or im not gonna do anything with myself im just gonna  be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever  and i wouldnt get anything done  uh very  anxious and nervous and i mean what if  i dont find  enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um  you know what what if i cant   keep a semblance of stability in my life and it its actually hard work to be stable laughter and i know its hard work to be stable but  what you know its just eh a lot of what ifs  and and i dont think its things that havent happened and its stupid and pointless to worry about things that havent happened and i know that  but it still happens ha it still creeps in  so thats actually  a source of  anxiety  but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it  but i i i know it its a cycle and ill go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is the fundamental thing i need to take of here  i mean what wha what is just extraneous and what can c what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue  and so  figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit but then somethingll pop up and the what ifs will come up again  mm ill have to  uh  figure it out again laughter but i know its a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it   you get over it pretty quickly you get through it  the last time i felt really happy i dont know zz um i  huh laughter thats a good question that actually ac that actually surprisingly stumped me  because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda eh in the middle um really like overjoyously happy i dont know  i im not i cant think of o of when that happened i dont know you dont know  perceptions of other people i mean  probably as somebody who  oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know  handles things as they come but i dont see myself as that   at all and its a it probably that i can think on my feet and im not afraid to  hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done  um that  and i can do it creatively and i try to  strive for balance  probably  probably the best things about me laughter  that im doing basically what i want with my life which even though its not all easy its not  um you know im not financially well off or anything its still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives cause i have an aunt that i really dont talk to  who and the reason why i dont talk to her is because shes always miserable i mean shes got a career that she  its more of a job that she fell into  cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didnt wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer  and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time   but her hands ha you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had um the actually my cousins father went and kinda stole all the money from her business so she lost her business   and she kinda she retired early cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early  she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it   and its like change your life if you hate your life so much change it  and the thing thi the thing im most proud of is  yeah im not as financially well off as she is but im doing what i want with my life you know i can  be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me  people i actually like in my life and  be happy with that  and i see a lot of people who arent  and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say im not like that  and im actually doing what i want even though theres sacrifices im still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now thank you laughter okay  thank you laughter goodbye
yes  im doing fine  im from los angeles california  wow wonderful weather um outdoor activities all the time too crowded pollution  the norm  i studied child communications um recently i just i would say yes preschool teacher  well ive always worked with children ever since i was eighteen years old so i figured doing something helping someone it doesnt pay well but youre investing in the future  wow some job that i could get paid to be outside all day get paid well to be outside all day  yes  im kinda quiet but i also like i probably would say borderline i like outside activities but i mainly kinda do um activities probably by myself so yeah i would say im an introvert slightly uh wow just um maybe a racist or disrespectful person i kinda shut down and and reevaluate how i am as a person how im coming off to other people i cant change anyone elses personality but i can work on my own   im pretty good  i usually dont argue with people i usually walk away i mean a argument doesnt settle anything  wow its a lot of things i regret but its not anything that i can control probably the biggest regret was losing my mother  thank you  i was extremely close to my mother that was who i am as a person who made me as a person  wow twenty ten years ago i would tell myself not to be so angry so  upset all the time about things i cant control i would tell myself to relax and not be so hard on myself  i think thats pretty cool i think you should have different avenues to deal with different people   clears throat no i have not  no i have not  yes  um less than a month  i realized i have to evaluate myself as a person so i cant really look to anyone else to help me unless i i start with myself no i dont  i feel like as a person as uh a individual i feel like i should be able to control things myself i feel like to go seek out help is good for someone else it probably is very good for other people ive worked with that population of ptsd um veterans before so i know that it helps a lot of people but i dont feel like its for me its not difficult at all ive always been like a loner someone who who tries to handle ha to handle my own problems and situations  a little depressed but i think everyone is it has a little bit of sadness in them at some point   day by day day by day i just started a exercise program so im trying to look at myself  for the solution  always known ever since i was a child things moved me differently than other kids so i felt like i was always different i felt like if i was gonna ever understand me as a person then i would have to work on myself so yes  um today i got to see my best friend after a long time so i mean happiness comes and goes but i felt happy today  wow he would say really silly um  but still when im around him i try to be happy i try to present a a a situation where were both gonna be happy no one wants to be around a depressed person  scrubbedentry wow i mean on certain days everything could be my best quality but i would say um im loyal im dependable um  i would just say i try to be there in the moment im not a person who who is really fat flashy f excuse me uh flashy or into materialistic things so i feel like im very grounded  oh my mother by far my sisters  uh my mom was a school teacher which made me wanna become a school teacher and thats basically what i have been doing uh my sister has been at her job for forty years so ive always had a stable influence in my life  wow i would say just sitting on a sunny nice day talking to my mother i would say that would bring a smile to my face immediately   wonderful  wonderful  i like to get out and play sports i play four or five different sports and um i like to go for a walk i like to ride my bike i like to get out and be active  having such a wonderful mother i mean i have to keep going back to that subject because were introduced into this life and thats our first teacher thats our first teacher and its gonna be our teacher for a very long time and uh im just very thankful im very proud to have had such a wonderful woman as my mother riding my bike simple things going for a walk with my sister exercising  uh just last sunday  well thank you 
yes um im okay i was born in san bernardino california  yes um im staying with a sister in north hollywood um she makes it as comfortable as possible uh i love the weather and the entertainment and the public transportation um its very difficult to find full time employment  and some of the people arent as friendly as people from the south cause i lived in the south before um those are the only two things no i dont i was an english major in college i havent finished yes i am um id like to be a recording singer yes um ive always loved to sing from the time that i was a child  at times um when im alone i am um extremely sigh i guess i would say um inter minded like i um have a lot of thoughts and i keep them to myself clears throat  so if im in that mode then i dont really um interact with people but i can also interact with people if i change modes um i just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago and last week on thursday no on tuesday um  usually i just try to um remain quiet and listen to the situation if its a person or if its a situation clears throat that im dealing with myself thats annoying i try to um think of alternate ways that would make the situation better  um come up with alternate plans so i wont get annoyed um pretty good um mm i may have had an argument a few weeks ago um just about timeliness like meeting on time and showing up on time and it was actually last um monday yeah mhm no um to just be cautious of peoples intentions and to listen really well cause people usually tell you what their intentions are without even um realizing re realizing it  um a good listener patient um fun loving generous um depressed sometimes um  but generally a good person no i have not yes um within a year and a half ago um i just knew that i often thought about situations that um happened in the past and kinda blamed the situation for my future and um um certain settings um if i  um see certain types of individuals in certain settings it just reminds me of when i was younger when things happened and changed my future plans so i um try to i used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time but now i feel like i um just handle things better as far as um being in the similar settings with similar people i just i um handle those things better i do um i like to believe that it does i dont worry as much um its just allowed me to know that actually speaking about the issues um relieves me of the tension of um holding them inside so thats how its helped me at first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it um it actually is good because i know that when things are occurring  um if im able to um communicate about them with a certain individual it um relieves me of the stress of of uh trying to figure out everything alone and often times um by speaking about the issues it um allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be be better just because im hearing myself speak of the issue  um i was diagnosed with depression and um my doctor felt that i should probably see the therapist um i am it depends um if im really busy during the week and have a lot of things to do i often try to plan things and if im planning things it affects my sleep i might wake up in the middle of the night so sometimes its easy and sometimes it isnt irritable um very v just very irritable um i was feeling anxious but now im calmer um today i dont but i have in the past week um because i was in the midst of um searching for a a stable s a stable place to live and um it was just taking so long to find a stable place to live so i was becoming anxious  thank you yes um  maybe in october um well my mother first came she came to visit me in october and when she first got here we had a good time for the first couple days um so i was happy to see her i hadnt seen her in over a year mhm um im proud that im able to um  adjust to different situations um the older ive gotten the more adaptable i am to t in different environments in different situations and um ive learned how to be more resourceful so im proud of that um im sorry oh my dad and uh my sister shes positive cause shes finished her masters degree um my mom sometime um my best friend is very positive cause she just started her new business two years ago and shes very enthusiastic about it so thats an inspiration  um when someone lies consistently  um i listen very very well um sometimes i um give good advice im a good friend um i normally do the things that i say im going to do so im dependable um i communicate well  and i um enjoy peoples company most of the time especially if theyre in good moods um being around positive people music um puts me in a good mood um comedy shows put me in a

home like ninety nine percent of the time and i wanted to go out and socialize with some ex coworkers and she basically kinda put me down for it as if i dont spend enough time with my children laughter  it does and i love my mom i hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her because i always think gosh i dont wanna get mad at her and then something happens to her the next day

questions they should be more motivated to uh really achieve something within their lives to give them the mm to give them the confidence and the motivation they need in life cause a lot of em dont get it sigh when i see people do really really stuff that they really shouldnt be doing  uh sigh it really eeks me i mean really bothers me and when people talk to you they give you the runaround its

trying to find the right word stupid stuff laughter that really botthers me too   uh spray painting on the wall  uh just throwing garbage anywhere and not picking it up uh not really being uh you know not really being  hygiene you know taking care of yourself and being hygiene you know what i mean  yeah  sigh what i do when im annoyed uh i get really upset i really start really cussing people out to be honest with you and its something thats not really me but uh im learning to really let go of it a lot you know just you know just say hey thats the way it is its like im not in control i cant control it yeah i have only have to control the things about what i do and really getting upset off of what other people do is not really good its not good for me oh my temper can be controlled i can control it pretty well  uh  i i dont know i think it probably was my sister and shes very controlling and its like you have your life and i have mine dont tell me what to do yeah  we real close i can get along with em were real close i have no problems with them   yeah very good  uh  this morning laughter  yeah i wake up pretty you know i i first thing i do when i wake up in the morning i pray so when my spirits in connection with the uh sigh the universe and the world i i feel pretty good   yes  uh sigh up and down you know up because im motivated to get out and start doing other things in life than just not doing anything at all and then other times where you wanna get something accomplished and you cant really get it done because theres road blocks in the way but uh im learning how to uh overcome those road blocks as well uh  well for instance uh looking to go to school and i was having problems uh getting enrolled in school i was talk to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me get online and uh to do it so im like okay its well its gonna get done laughter yeah  uh can you repeat that one more time maam  uh yes i have  see i had to be uh sigh id say uh for the last couple of weeks uh i noticed that i go through certain situations like you was talking about the anger situation its like i dont get angry all the time thats not me so sometimes when i get angry i have to find out whats causing all this whats whats causing me to get angry  and i have to take  excuse me maam  uh its not hard at all cause alls you have to do is just take your time and reflect about everything uh that you have gone through and uh take a good look at the situation and uh and then go from there and find out whats whats really bothering you  its very seldom  uh i suffer from ptsd and uh getting that type of sleep would be would be great  because i have recurring nightmares so of a incident so  sigh i i think it is and i dont know what its triggered by but i think it is and thats why im talking to someone or seeing someone cause im a veteran  at the uh va about the situation now about the ptsd basically right now  excuse me maam  uh sigh a lot of nightmares lot of problems lot of anger issues uh depression uh i noticed all this in me and uh i started i just started to just tell myself i needed help  and thats thats basically it i just you know i just you know i just something wasnt wrong with it something wasnt right with me  and when somethings not right with me i have to take time out to just you know take a good look at myself and ask myself if somethings right then you if somethings right then thats fine if somethings not right then you need to take care of it   and uh i just started seeking help down there yeah  somewhat yes it is somewhat  cause im able to sit down and talk to the therapist  well im able to sit down and talk to the therapist and uh tell em my situation and we usually will go over the problem and uh i went to classes ive been to uh uh talking oneonone with my own doctor so its helping out a little bit  yeah  its a good thing excuse me maam no no not really  my best friend  uh they he would describe me as a fun loving good person always there that try to help others uh  think more of others really than more of myself but when i know i need things need to be done for me i take care of it so you know and they really actually they really look up to me they have a lot more respect for me yeah they see something in me they wish that they had   excuse me maam uh can you be a little bit more specific  oh okay  uh books crossword puzzles uh walking thats about it  i thought i did but i dont think i do i dont think i regret anything because  this is this is how it is this is the way it is for me so i accept it and i keep moving on  because if i regret anything in the past then im wasting my time on that because its gone thats the past i need to move on i need to live in the present so i can be prepared for the future so i can move on to the future  yeah  sharp inhale uh sigh more education uh  being more direct and more confidence in what im doing like i am today so yeah thats what i was lacking maybe twenty years ago  uh yes ye yes i have had a lot of positive people been been in my life  uh sigh yeah some people would uh uh uh well consistently cons xxx i mean consistently motivate me to continue and to pursue a certain goal and uh i thought that was pretty good because i really dont see that a lot and uh he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things cause anything that you do its a choice its up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done   excuse me maam  uh sigh that im able to really be able to be selfmotivated and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things accomplished which i thought i couldnt but it can be accomplished if im willing enough to put the will to it to do it oh wow huh  oh really and you know what i really enjoyed was sitting down with my social worker and were talking about getting things done within my life and school was one of em uh  and just being just school was one of em and i kinda liked it that because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me  yeah and i thought that was a great thing so as long as youre willing to do that im willing to go even the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school and uh yeah that and that and thats what gets me going oh it is and i love it and uh this is going to be accomplished  thank you  goodbye

wrong um i just always like kinda nervous around people like i never can really like look anybody in the eye cause im just so nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i um would have sweats

part of this laughter  um most proud of uh well sigh um im trying to think of what im most proud of um  i  think im most proud of like the fact that i am able to you know not be like well i mean most people i know they like deny that they have a problem and im proud that i can actually like you know be a person who can realize okay i have a problem and i need help but a lot of the people i know they dont take medication theyre untreated and um they just dont wanna get any help and im glad to get help because i dont wanna feel that way and i wanna get help for the problem instead of doing that  oh gosh theres a lot i regret yeah theres a lot um i regret you know uh drug abuse you know but thats part of you know the ptsd i regret um a lot uh mistakes you know relationships stuff like that  wow um i wouldve told myself to um i guess the advice i wouldve given myself was to  try to keep my mind more relaxed i guess yeah um well im a very nice person and i always like to smile people

people  just a little  i just like um going to new places and just discovering new things  um i recently went to new york i was there for about three months  um and it was extremely boring i went to western new york  um and it was extremely uh snowy and um  i didnt didn was in a position where i didnt have a car so i didnt get to go very many places and i was in a small town   so um  i uh  uh it was beautiful for what i got to see but really  it wasnt really much to it laughter  yeah  um  both im both an introvert and an extrovert  um  i really enjoy doing things by myself  um  i um have a lot of my own um my likes and dislikes and ive spent a lot of time alone even though um i have ha i do have a lot of friends and uh when i do go out i i do tend to meet a lot of people but um i also enjoy um being by myself a lot  um  probably outgoing creative um  talented  um fun trustworthy  um  i studied language um  and um physics  and um  math no im not  im actually um im um im trying to be an actress  it was something that i fell into when i was a teenager  scrubbedentry and uh i really enjoyed doing it and i hadnt done it for years um  so i figured why not i just came back to california and might as well try something that i did enjoy really doing   um so far um i just got picked up by an agent  so i havent really done anything yet as an adult  but um  im hoping  hoping something itll be fruitful   um  sigh i really dont havent had too many  um  i guess my sister shes done really well  um  my boyfriend hes a  hes a very positive human being  um  but um  really i havent had too many positive influences  um  im close i mean we w we hang out um i i dont tell them everything  um theyre kind of judgmental  but um  other than that i mean i mean we hang out i mean i see them every day  um  geez um  its kinda hard for me to relax um i mean i try to watch tv um and i read  a lot um  thats probably about it i read i do a lot of sleeping laughter im a little depressed so um  yeah its kinda its xxx like i said its really hard for me to relax  um  it isnt  um i tend to think a lot  um about the things that stress me out  um ive been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um  yeah so i i dont i dont i dont sleep very well at night and if i do fall asleep i wake up all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks  um  i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh  has affected me throughout the years so um  its usually you know like i ill dream about something that stressed me out and then ill wake up and my my chestll hurt    um  or just i just cant sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i dont know if im afraid to go to sleep  but i uh sigh i just i dont know i feel like that th thats a vulnerable place for me  because of stuff thatve happened to me  so um  i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well  um  tired  im uh  im moody im very sensitive  um  i uh im just negative ne a negative person  um which really thats not me um  i uh yeah im like l judgmental is not me either um i just  im just not a not a nice person to be around  um  i try to t i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um  just to keep myself involved  um so that i dont uh sit si just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i cant sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can  um by running around and and and doing things  so  um its difficult  um i do like there is a part of me that doesnt wanna  i dont really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh  i make appointments to like for auditions or or um  even to do this i um i i tend to uh  just not  like at the last minute ill ill try to convince myself not to go laughter but then i force myself to anyways   yes  um ive been diagnosed for two instances  um i was diagnosed dia diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago  and then i was diagnosed again um in august um  the first time it was um  i just wasnt sleeping sl because of the not sleeping um   and the uh just the stress st the unbelievable stress  um  and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um  and i just i i just couldnt take it anymore  so i i figured um  i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um  not thinking life was worth it and and i i i thats i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated  yeah  it was  i no n do not um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um  get out of my environment  um and uh  and that seemed to help a lot  um  and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didnt really seem to be helping me much  um they just  they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i dont believe that thats what i needed  um  yeah so um  yeah  sigh stressed um uh lately ive been really sad and i dont know why   um  but like i said ive been trying to combat that by um   keeping myself busy  um  actually um  im kind of a couple days ago  i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy   um but then i went back to  being you know going back to feeling miserable  so um  well i realized  i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep  and um  i realized uh that im actually really lucky  um cause ive been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me  and uh  you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that  and that made me really happy  um  yeah  thank you laughter oh geez um  ive had so many years of just  just bad just a lot of bad  that it there has its been a long time  since ive been proud of anything  i guess if anything its my ability to survive through all the hardships ive been through  um my m a lesser person i guess wouldve  gotten rid of themselves a long time ago  but um even though like im really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel fe just feel miserable about a lot of things um  theres gotta be a silver lining  so  um so yeah so i mean like i guess thats what im proud of that uh  i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasnt ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people  and um  and truthful and i still i still have drive in me  yeah  ugh sigh so much um  my last marriage um not getting out when i should have  um  and uh just i regret a lot sigh um the any situation that wouldve had a red flag um  eh just get out of it you know eh some things just dont work and um  no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um  i i would tell myself um to um  that its not selfish  to let go of a bad situation  and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself  so if had i known that then had had i known that then i i i probably wouldve done better in life so  yeah  sigh um people who um  when people are down on me for my faults  um that i have done that i have things that ive done in my past that people steal still relive when im trying to forgive myself um  people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy um just anybody who picks on the little guy  um  you know people who dont care about the environment or animals um  i just jus i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be  and uh its its disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just cant be people dont let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do  and uh i that makes me mad  laughter i vent laughter um  yeah i tend to vent and then uh  and them um and then its usually over i try not to bad mouth people um i try to just talk through it until um until its gone and then it doesnt bother me anymore mm i try not to get angry um  because i have a really bad temper and it um  and it can get outta hand so um  what i do is i i laughter something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap  um laughter if im not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind and come back to it  um  it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um  it was about um  actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her  and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um  i was i was tired um i was it was late and um  i started to yell at a back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um  and you yo sigh its uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didnt care about you know peoples things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and im not im so far from that person   um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue  mm kinda petty and stupid but  at the time it it seemed  it seemed uh  viable  um  hmm one of my most memorable experiences  um  god go ive had so many um  maybe it was um  i dont know um  it was  probably um  graduating pharmacy school  um i felt pretty great i didnt know if i was doing  uh very very well or not um and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i getting get ended up getting like ninety eight percent  and um  i uh  i actually i didnt did i had no confidence laughter that i had done well in class in school at all and i i didnt even know how i was getting the grades i was getting um so that was a really big accomplishment for me um  and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah  yeah  um  im reliable  um  i um  im talented  um i im a good listener um  im always there to help people  um  i tend to always try to do the right thing  um  sometimes actually i forget that i have any good qualities but  um  and just  i uh  all around i try to be you know as as good and the best person that i can be to other people and myself um  yeah  um  going to comedy shows  um  just um  having moments where you just laugh with people  um  sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood uh  i dont know probably thats about it  uh huh

be i dont know if that makes sense but  um sigh accessibility to to different things um as compared to nebraska um you know more opportunities to do different things and and explore different things  areas of interest uh the crime um  attitude laughter um  uh lack of lack of uh  uh work ethic lack of uh  kindness in people um cutthroat  yeah  i used to quite a bit  uh sense of freedom  the uh the adventure  um okay  you want me to tell you about a trip laughter uh egypt  i  yeah  uh i went with my mother and some family friends we went on an eight day cruise down the nile saw all the uh pyramids in giza um just it was just a incredible adventure just to get away from everything and everybody and and uh close friends and just have a great time  yeah  um not really at all  um just uh uh have history of um abuse and and neglect and uh just not a real functional family dysfunctional is is definitely a keyword in our family so  thank you um no not really im talked about it a lot before um so  im okay with it  sigh um sigh laughter its really hard to say i havent had very good uh uh very positive role models um um  ask me the question again  sigh well maybe at best my mother  but uh shes a shes also been a negative uh aspect of my life but um  uh yeah i guess i cant really identify anybody whos been a real real positive influence in my life  um the the trips that ive been on  um i used to  work out i used to do yoga i used to um  i used to meditate i used to exercise and i used to um i used to do a lot of things lately um i find it uh hard to relax i dont have the same uh  the same outlets that i did before the same uh i ss i i dont pursue them as much anymore i guess im ive lost my motivation or something im depressed about it you know i guess there it is right there  um pretty good i i is temper as far as getting to the point of uh uh physicality i dont ever that um  uh but i stand my ground and um but i can control my temper i i i never lose control really   um sigh the last time  uh probably  um as recently as you know  in the last month or so i maybe argued with um  uh an acquaintance over um  uh laughter uh i dont know i i have to come back to that question  no no yes um  well officially october of last year but ive i think ive been depressed longer than that but officially october of last year  um  actually i was uh being treated for other medical issues and um my depression was notable to the doctors so yeah  yeah  um  well ive never been suicidal but just to just to just in i i just often have thought um  eh that i dont have much reason to to live i used to think i had a purpose and such but um i dont really have anybody in my life um  who i think cares enough about me uh  that i really rea if i was even dead uh so um ive kind of lost myself  and um i used to that used to be enough  that i was um enough to uh  you know to to have purpuse in my life but um  ive lost quite a bit of that  motivation motiv yeah  well im trying to pull it together im trying to um  sigh get back a sense of me  i get inspired every once in awhile but um overall i just dont seem to be making much progress  yeah  i wouldnt really call it therapy i dont have a therapist per se i have a a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me and nobody really to talk about psychosocial issues  um i uh huh  did you say that sucks eh  okay  and uh yeah  um overwhelmed preoccupied um  just uh trying to stay alive stay on top of things  no uh  easy when i can i dont um  yeah when i if i get a chance to fall asleep i dont have any problem with it  um even more distracted and uh um  um even more  uh lackluster i guess is the word  whatever uh if i had a best friend um sigh i dont know um sigh he maybe lot of positive adjectives before but now just you know just uh some people say i should be proud cause im surviving a hard time or some people think that uh  im a a loser  laughter so um i dont know sigh maybe um  a survivor uh persistent um um well i used to be proud of my career and um  kinda giving back to people giving back to society um cause i was given  a lot it felt like um sigh so im just proud to uh  i dont have much of a sense of pride anymore to be quite honest i ive um it uh i dont know sigh laughter psychology and um  well initially yeah  um no not really per se although my current career involves a lot of uh  psychology a lot of um  uh the aspects i dont know what im trying to say um  its a part p its a part of it but its not the center of it  um well i guess if my career is still going im in uh nursing but um ive been sick lately and with depression and other healthcare problems i  uh have uh found it necessary to apply for disability social security income  and im starting the process of that cause im not working   very sigh educating people um making a difference i mean i used to i had ive had my dream jobs ive had my dream jobs i dont uh  i dont know what the future will hold for for uh work but um  something i suppose working with people again health uh helping in some way  um no but lately with the depression more so at times i used to say that i never regretted anything cause i would make the best decision of all things in front of me but um  i just wish there were times then that um  the choices that i would have were  laughter were better cause some choices that i seem to have made or were made for me have um made my world kind of shitty   for lack of a better word shitty  what i dont understand  sigh  to be strong to um believe in myself  to remember that ive survived a lot of things and i will survive this too   to get up off my ass and move to um sigh to have confidence faith  um sigh i just murphys law has kicked my ass   so much you know i just uh  it it seems like when ive tried to make my world better i just keep getting knocked down um so it its almost like im i dont wanna give up but um every time i try and move forward i get knocked back and it gets gets exhausting  and i dont have any support system really nobody not really  sigh um  loyal um hardworking  um  dependable  um  uh capable um well at least i used to be uh  intelligent  comtemplative um eh uh deep not a superficial person um  yeah i guess those are some of them  many years ago  um i used to have a lot of confidence i used to be pretty dynamic person i used to be people would wou say s used to say that i was the most centered person that they knew and i used to help people and im now in their shoes and i dont seem to be able to help myself  sigh  sigh  i cant think of anything right now laughter i cant think of really anything right now  i dont do much anything for fun anymore i used to however um go to movies and and entertainment venues and travel go to dinner with friends do things um but lately i dont i dont really have any pursuits   a good day a happy day a fun day for me is a day without something going wrong  basically  laughter  mhm yeah  bye
yes  im doing fine thank you  originally im from well i was born in mississippi so im from gulfport mississippi  yes  i didnt have a choice i was a child i moved here with my parents  laughter uh when i was two years old  laughter yes i was i was a toddler  yes i like to travel and i travel a lot  um being around new environments and new people uh different things  cough um well one of my favorite trips was visiting africa in i think two thousand six i visited uh west africa and that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and gave medical assistance to people  a friend of mine uh was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so i went in with her and it went from there so i dont know i made the decision that way   i am i am happy i did that its something ill never forget laughter  i studied english and education so that i could teach high school students  uh not currently no well right now i um tutor privately for a private tutoring company and looking to get back into the classroom working as a teacher  mhm wow anything that uh combines teaching traveling and writing would be a dream job for me so yeah anything that combines those three items so teaching has the closest outcome to that    um  occasionally yes laughter um clears throat  i dont know i guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing um and and a lot of people have said i seem reserved or kinda introverted i dont know   mm well  i dont know i read um i just started meditation  mm try to breathe and calm down laughter yeah  some things that make me really mad um  mistreatment of children  abuse of children  um try to figure out whats annoying me usually and then go from there uh if i can control not being annoyed like ultimately i control that whether or not im annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not be annoyed laughter if i can help it all  oh im fine i can totally to in at controlling my temper i think so i dont have a yeah    the last time i argued with someone  was um  i dont know maybe a couple of days ago and it was about um it was about um a smell they had on their clothes but i thought smelled like perfume and they said it did not so laughter  yeah  laughter this is cool uh i think im very close to my family were a pretty close knit family talk every day um see each other almost every day  thereve been a lot of positive um influences in my life i would say my aunt and uh definitely my mother have all been positive influences  well um i look i look l i uh clears throat look up to my aunt um i think shes positive i look up to her  because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and shes very successful um despite the types of things that weve gone through as children  and um she doesnt let her past define her future uh my moms overcome so many obstacles as well um she had some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and shes still tries to   you know overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to  you know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible   no i have not  no i have  um well i was diagnosed um within the last um year and uh then again most recently within the last three months  well um fear and just not knowing what to do with uh some of the things i was feeling and not knowing um you know why i couldnt stop feeling the way i was feeling  there were a lot of symptoms um  um you know mostly i uh i gained a lot of weight um i couldnt sleep a lot and then sometimes i could sleep too much laughter um  felt sad sometimes  like i wanted to cry a lot  ive been feeling okay um there are days yeah um i dont know every day is different so i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything is differently lately ive been feeling um more like i can be involved inv involved in my own life and like i wanna get   out and do more things  um  no no its no no i havent  not any different from before what i was experiencing before  no  mm well mm i was receiving um  uh i guess psychotherapy and um i dont know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda  got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while  uh sometimes  i do  yes it is its kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep im sure it is i just dont know what it is as of yet because i you know sniffle usually its um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep mhm um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps other than that i dont you know i havent found any really great ways of coping  it tired laughter  yeah mostly uh tired um kinda confused  i dont know for the most part i feel happy its just um   last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays  uh i dont know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general thats just a happy time for me and seeing people i havent seen in a while um thats about it  how would my best friend describe me probably as um  quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious  um i dont know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because im caring and compassionate or um easy to talk to um that i remind them of a of o feel like a sister to them  laughter  um everyone has regrets im sure yeah i regret stuff  to just  relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i dont mean to sound that way but its true its just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what youre supposed to be doing at that time it doesnt mean that youre less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their  their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and dont be  yeah  um really enjoyed working with um well  okay a science project laughter with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball um being the first to attend college in my family and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so  uh im most proud of being able to  have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and help someone else improve and better themself as well   goodbye 
yes clears throat okay um new york um to pursue um music industry a job in the music industry  uh yes im selfemployed um to become a music producer um its pretty hard theres a lot of competition laughter um to pursue a job uh when um about a year ago last february it was pretty difficult east coast is a lot different than the west coast um i think ive been there twice in the past year no im more of a creature of habit um yes uh sometimes i feel like i dont fit into the crowd so um its better just sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of uh you know going in and actively pursue things um laughter probably uh listen to music um and spend time with my dogs um clears throat probably um people being insensitive insen um not very um very nice to me or um seeing injustices or um i think thats about it laughter um pretty good you know sometimes so um probably couple of days ago um one of my friends was saying that um mm uh they were making a comment about how i am and i got kind of upset about that yeah it does laughter pretty close um my best friend so i um oh just one of my friends um i kind of am quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point thats when i overreact usually um its pretty hard um i rather the person notice that im kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where its like um it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion  um um probably spending time with my family in new york very close um my sister and my brother um i dont know theyre just great people and i love them a lot and theyre a lot like me so i feel like i have people that understand me um probably um i guess loyal um sensitive um laughter  i dont know its kind of hard laughter its a hard question laughter no no clears throat  yes gosh um i think probably nineteen ninety seven so a long time ago um im just uh during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going um to the doctor to kinda get meds and have therapy and stuff um not currently i i did about like six months ago um i just felt the therapist wasnt really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and xxx she wasnt really challenging me and ive been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change its okay laughter um yes i do actually um  when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like its a really great way for me to talk about what im going through um so yes i do um im better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um when im in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um    also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself so its nice to talk to someone thats not judging that doesnt really tell me like you know um they tell me its o okay basically clears throat um feeling hopeless all the time not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues  um having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life  um sometimes they are at  like random moments that if theres like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television um like sometimes that affects me  um listening to music or trying to distract myself um trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things clears throat  um its been a tough transition to come here so uh well being be being here um so um kinda half and half okay and not okay laguhter  um i feel like ive been a little bit with more withdrawn lately um but thats about it um clears throat some days its great some days its not um more recently its been a little bit more difficult um i dont know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night clears throat so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night clears throat um clears throat very groggy in the morning and um thats about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like oh why are you yawning so much are you disinterested disisinterested in what were doing and then trying to tell them its not that at all laughter um probably christmas time when i was with my family  um just really happy and um feeling like everything was alright in my life  having a good sense of like where i was at that moment being present with myself um probably you know um lets see thats a hard question i think probably i can tend to read people kinda well sometimes and um  uh i like to say uh im good at like being a good friend to people being a good family member um im a hard worker when i do have a job so laughter  um um sure i mean its life so of course theres regrets um one that comes to mind is um the wish that i dont eat as much so i can be a lot more healthy laughter  um dont take things so seriously laughter um enjoy being youthful and um i think thats it laughter um i dont know thats a good question probably um my previous job and my employment i worked really well with kids um  so i did a great job at that i was um a researcher um at a hospital and i helped a lot of kids out for about six years so seven years  yeah it was awesome um i was really kind of like um  reading people and so i decided to major in psychology clears throat so uh and then i went a worked in a um mental health facility and did research um with them with um with drugs and depression and things like that so it found like a good niche for me laughter okay no problem laughter goodbye laughter
yes  im doing pretty good laughter  im from oklahoma  mhm yup oklahoma city  uh the weather is great i love being near the ocean and the palm trees and uh mountains i just love it here laughter um it was pretty easy theres a few differences its a huge city compared to where im from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me laughter  um i just always wanted to live in california uh hated being landlocked in oklahoma just wanted to get out to the west coast be near the ocean   i studied psychology and minored in art  um no not at the moment  um well actually i think i misunderstood your question im not still working on my degree but i am working in the field of psychology i well i just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law  my dream job oh  i dont really know i think i just wanna help people however i can and um i just like working with people in the realm of psychology so i think i may already have my dream job laughter to relax i like to read or watch movies um i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or um hang out with friends  things that make me really mad um probably injustice towards other people um people being mistreated or abused um and people being lied to and deceived including myself i hate being lied to laughter  when im annoyed uh depends on the situation but i try to just like count to ten and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything  um it depends again on the situation and like who im angry with um most of the time im pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like like most people ill lash out at the people that im closest to at times and and those moments im not that good at controlling it  sigh when was the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my parents um ive been having some some car trouble lately and im also running low on money so im sure i dont even remember exactly but im sure we kind of probably fought about the fact that i you know need to be more selfsufficient and independent take care of my own laughter things like car issues  i am very close with my family theyre still in oklahoma but i talk to them on the phone all the time  oh definitely i mean my mom i think um shes probably the person that im closest to and she just  shes a great role model shes a wonderful person and shes very hardworking and very unselfish and i just wanna be like her in those ways  oh probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river in uganda um i still kinda have flashbacks of that moment just freefalling it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time laughter yeah well i have ha i have traveled a lot nowadays i dont travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line um norwegian cruise line and so i would go travel all the time with them and then i also did an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped out in different third world countries it was really cool  uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um because its easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that theres a huge world out there and theres all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and its just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool  no i have not served in the military laughter  nope no ive never been formally diagnosed although i would say ive probably diagnosed myself with depression um just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years ive im probably ninety nine percent sure that ive struggled with depression off and on so yeah   lately its been pretty easy but throughout the years ive definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now im not really experiencing too much of that but in the past its definitely been an ongoing issue for me   im not a pleasant person when i dont sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function  ive been feeling really good um  over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think ive been going through a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but its like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i dont have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this citys really expensive and i dont have a job and so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good laughter um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so ive become a lot more  positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way its just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to kind of just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how its been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good laughter    oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually i went um  i went to explore a part of the south bay area that i hadnt really been to before and it was i was just gonna go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and um it was just beautiful and then i i went for a drive up off kind of off this like cliff where theres beautiful scenery that id never seen before and i just like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i cant believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me laughter  my best friend would probably say that im very daring and bold and fearless um that im unique and artistic and i dont i would guess that shed probably say that im a nonconformist i dont really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah laughter  um  probably just like the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and ive tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i im not really afraid i dont let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that im really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if its hard i still im proud that ive overcome a lot of those struggles  oh theres like minor things that i regret throughout my life but theres not anything really major cause i think pretty much everything that ive done ive learned from whether its good or bad so i wouldnt really change anything  oh sigh i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i  should just keep dreaming big and dont let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anythings possible because um i guess as ive grown into an adult ive really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do  oh  lets see thats kind of hard laughter  um oh i guess i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadnt seen in some of em i hadnt seen in like since i graduated so um which has been like four years ago so um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun  cool youre welcome  bye 
yes  im okay  um pennsylvania  mhm um well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but um i just wasnt satisfied with the quality of my life um maybe once or twice last year i only got to back once a year um definitely safer and um definitely a more um well i just miss it cause i have a lot of family back there but la is okay i i mean everyone loves the climate here um  not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend ive been with for three years so that helps hes from here but um it definitely took a a bit of adjustment  no um advertising communications  um no im currently working in actually im not working right now at the moment um i wanna be an osteopathic physician  um so basically versus western medicine an osteopathic physician is someone who helps someone with the symptoms and doesnt just treat the symptoms but treats them as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise um just a variety of things to t to actually get someone to live  a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the western medicine  um well one of the great things was when i came out here to la i was um exposed to the degree which i had never heard of living on the east coast   um sometimes  um well im very particular about the people i like to surround myself with um and eh i dont like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to um like small intimate groups and i dont tend to like to be in larger or bigger groups um eh when people dont take into account other peoples feelings  um i usually  try to go for a walk if i get laughter very irritated  um im usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset   um sigh lets see uh mm i was at with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case  yeah it was hes uh theyre i dont know i think theyre just a little bit mediocre theyre not the best lawyers   i have no idea laughter  um im very trustworthy im loyal um i care very deeply so i i like to try to help other people um and i always like to try to cheer people up so laughter i think thats that would be some of em  no yes  um just a few months ago about in the last six months  um i was experiencing  mental issues that id never really came across before paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasnt  um i knew that i it wasnt that i couldnt overcome it by myself  um a lot better ive been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another ano not per pe per view but a different view and um  thats helped but theres definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working   um  i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um im still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so im not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings and um i dont like to go into places where theres only one way in and one way out um well ive been gradually trying to increase how much im outside um  and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and i just try to say that basically what im thinking or whats going on with me is not real um and that   i just i try laughter i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home    um  its been good um its been good to hear someones feedback but um i feel like ive gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling  i do  um sigh well i feel like more like myself which is a huge improvement um and i am more cautious and er guarded in some ways about my thoughts um and about my decisions as well im not so im not so oh you know ill just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that i want in my life   um its gotten better im okay ok im better now um the first three months it was very difficult i couldnt sleep through the night and i woke maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours but now i am um sleeping through the night again  um i feel f groggy sigh k i feel foggy and out of it um  and just low kind of depressed  mm sigh its um i think its been awhile  um working laughter im a bit of a workaholic um spending time with my family um yeah just being outside enjoying nature reading um very close  what is that  um scrubbedentry um well my parents cause theyve always been very supporting and loving um giving me feedback about my decisions or what im choosing to do but allowing me to make my own um decisions my own choices in life and then  my sisters have just always been very um you know just always checking with me im the baby im the youngest in the family so they always um  looking out for me and just checking in with me and then my boyfriend xxx with this um incident that happened um hes been very uh usually supportive with just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when im feeling and not wanting to go out in public and and being aware of that that its not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop or um running errands without having a lot of anxiety  um im most proud of  the jobs the work that ive done the people ive helped um  maybe that i took this job where i was assaulted at laughter that would be it going into retail into unsafe environment not listening to my gut  um  what advice would i what uh to recklessly pursue your dreams um that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and and to enjoy every moment of your life not take anything for granted  um  lets see uh sigh well cooking i really enjoy enj i really enjoy cooking um  so i made some roasted vegetables just any time im cooking i just really enjoy it um we have a garden so we had collard greens that came up and um some chilis and cauliflower so just using preparing that for f um for my um boyfriend and i  mhm bye thanks 
yes im alright with this doing pretty good little bit tired im from los angeles the weather and the sports cant find any jobs right now i know um not really i studied um architecture and chicano studies and a little bit of history  uh since si i was wa little li since i was little i liked to draw and then i like to learn about history im trying to im going im working and going to school im trying to get my finish gettin my degree playing in the nfl what was that um i dont know what that is eat or sleep people not doing they jobs walk away um pretty good like three days ago a couple days ago over some family issues um sure well um like to workout play football and ride my bike um walking on that ucla i felt big like i actually was doing something with myself my parents like they struggle strug they whenever they struggle they still manage to put through whatever they want and im pretty close real close uh quiet um my height and strength  mm no no no its pretty hard uh i i get home late and im usually up for like fifteen to like eighteen hours during the day so by the time i get home im really not even that tired to go to sleep yeah uh if i dont sleep well i get i wake up grumpy or like not in the mood to do things  mm just like under pressure a little bit not that hard i just stress pretty much sometimes just working i really dont like working but i have to so  um a little bit like its not im not like a little bit more violent but just a side s just a side effect from not playing football for a while music eating or and working out um i dont know raising my son and while i was still in school in high school no patience watching your son grow uh i have a five and a half year old boy i dont only see him on the weekend pretty close spoiled theyre theyre so advanced with everything that it makes the like their grandparents feel like dinosaurs while they already they just born and they already know how to use everything around their house cant treat em like kids anymore mm so you pretty much treat em like adults sometimes it works some it doesnt do it doesnt really work no should have just stayed on one path follow my dreams probably like or just follow what i wanted to do and thats about it a couple months ago um i was i was playing football i was playing for a junior college and we made it to the championship bowl that was probably the happiest ive been in awhile  good thank you bye
yes alright  i was born in uh los angeles california  uh well the weather and uh  the fact that uh people arent so obtrusive like on the east coast  uh just the uh the traffic and the the smoggy weather  i used to im unemployed now so i rarely go anywhere  i have a bs in uh business with a uh computer uh option i thought that the only place i could get a job with a business bu business degree was in accounting or in business computer methods so i took that i took business computer methods option  oh id probably be like uh a professional sports player or an actor something something that you enjoy doing  i like to uh ride my bike i like to watch sporting events now i cant afford to go to them so i pretty much watch on tv  i like to travel but like i say that i dont have money for that anymore  thats alright  uh sigh people who are chicken heads they get their nose in other peoples business even if theyre just strangers you expect that from a family member or or a friend but you know especially with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what orwell was referring to when he spoke of big brother in nineteen eighty four  uh i dont do much much different than i would otherwise  uh and ive had many temper outbursts uh  i kinda argue with my aunt  and it was because she was basically  making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative and uh it annoyed me greatly   uh im kind of on the outs with my parents  im kind of the black sheep  oh uh i mean my moms done the most to help me shes done a lot you know more than uh anybody by far well i mean shes just  i remember one time when i was in like thirteen i went with a friend of mine to see the crosby stills nash and young concert at the forum  and she has seven kids and she picked me up at the sizzlers right across the street from the forum at uh eleven oclock at night and i couldnt imagine with all she had to do that day that she agreed to do that but she did  oh probably uh  going down to the cape at the end of uh baja peninsula theres cabo san lucas or taking ta photographing the bridalveil falls in yosemite  uh it was probably the two most majestic seen see sights ive ever seen  it was when i could afford to travel  no no i was diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in april of two thousand eleven    and uh i took some lexapro but i stopped after one day i didnt wanna do it anymore  no because i didnt feel it was helpful i feel i was becoming a zombie  yeah  depressed about not having a job for over two years i lost my job in october two thousand and ten and except for day you know jobs like this which im fortunate to get just you know daily things focus groups like that i havent worked  thank you  especially when youre fifty six years old  well mm eh just uh it just the i guess the general feeling of hopelessness   i get out on my bicycle a lot and walk or bike just four hours a day split about two hours each  yeah good to get some very easy  cause now im old when i was young i couldnt sleep more than six s four six hours a night  because im restless  no but now that im old i i i sleep much more easily  i pray before i go to sleep and thats thats thats when i cant have any trouble sleeping i just pray recite different prayers like the lords prayer hail mary stuff like that and im able to fall off to sleep  i dont know probably uh  cant have any specific remembrances  of of that you know it was when i had money to spend i know that and when i had to have a job to have money to spend so it was probably fifteen years ago  well i havent really enjoyed anything uh last week i did a uh made seventy five dollars on a job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and they enlisted people to play the basically the relatives of people who had been in a in a fall uh bombing at the staples center and we you know asked questions signed up you know told em gave em the information im missing  you know relatives and basically it was provided by the county and basically went through a routine in downtown la  not not hard it was just uh just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually missing somebody and had to give the specifics of their characteristics height weight etcetera    i dont have a best friend  uh  im uh very bright im a perfectionist at my job  id say thats about it  i got a business degree and ive never been a motivated person i went to school i went to two state colleges and two junior colleges to meet that end so i believe that was probably the most significant contribution con contribution that i i made to my  you know to my uh i guess self esteem you might say so i had something to hang on the wall  yeah i regret you know  alienating family members  i wouldve uh  basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs thinking think thinking that  you know i could always get another one and not you know basically blow off jobs i could probably work at one of the employers that i used to work for now  theyve added locations but i burned bridges there so thats not possible  thank you  hasta luego 
yes  okay  from here from eh from alhambra  uh the weathers really nice and everythings very familiar  uh sometimes theres too much congestion on the roads too too much traffic  i i studied art and photography uh it it wasnt so much a decision i just kept noticing that i was very interested in it  yes  im a photographer  mhm oh i suppose uh  um running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business  uh no not no im an also an apartment manager it keeps me tied down  um its uh fair its not the greatest because of being an apartment manager ive i do have free rent but i have to stay there a lot so  that part does the free rent part is very good  oh gosh my most memorable experience thats hard to say  um  well i mean theres good and bad memorable experiences  oh well i guess some s s s like sport success when i was in high school there was a few of the things that i was happy about and some art pieces ive made were memorable and  some bad things would be my fathers death you know but those are very memorable not good though  uh  well my parents and my i i have a lot of brothers and sisters uh so s so the my family uh fairly close but they most of them live around la uh theres a few that are from far f distant di uh distant my brother lives in new york and   my other brother lives in maui clears throat  mhm oh mostly very talented ss um just um more involved in technology than maybe i was or am and theyre um i think theyre more of a hive mind than when i grew up just seems like they were all hooked into social media  uh go on a walk or watch television  or play with my computer  and uh um well  theres some so some uh  theres some kind of uh  injustices that happen in not not n not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking eh thats kind of upsetting and the city doesnt seem to wanna  uh make any exceptions or change some rules  and also uh some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting ups uh that are upsetting uh yeah i worked for f in school sch uh uh at a high school sch i worked at a high school dance uh this last weekend and when we arrived at the site   the people at the site said we couldnt set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it that we had to go outside  and then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we werent prepared for nor no nor told in advance that we were to be outside um it delayed our setup time and that doesnt does wouldnt have bothered me except that on monday morning um the school called call called our boss and complained that we were late setting up when it when they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and  and our work doesnt back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which to would translate into less payroll hours for the the photographers that were on that job  thats yeah thats how they do things so that that is upsetting  uh most of the time that will i i dust off my resume laughter and start looking for other situations that are that might be better um  yeah  uh pretty good sigh i i i usually xxx might uh i in the moment i dont really lose it but xxx later i might um vent or something like that but on the spot sp on the location i wouldnt do that  um well just today um we have a uh schedule sc tight schedule today and i have a friend that im car c sharing a car with today and uh we we were arguing where to go first  and um so we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things then after  this th this was one of the things is over then were gonna do some more of her things so but it yeah  no posttraumatic stress syndrome is that what that is  uh no i have not yes  oh sigh id say nineteen eighty yeah i think believe it was nineteen eighty yeah  um well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well hes passed away but he was a psychiatrist  um well i wasnt sleeping i was laying around the house  um i was waking up at noon laughter something like and i didnt have a um focus like for getting a job it wasnt clear enough uh i i remember some job interviews that id go to their front door and then i wouldnt go in laughter and i think that was all all part of depression  yeah i thought i had a problem but i didnt know what it was  no uh well eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that  he thought that i was done laughter but uh and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see whats going on with depression so i think i ill have good days and bad days  um i think therapy makes you see what the um  like the i i thought of it as a filter or wearing a pair pa as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you dont really you see everything through that so you have to kinda k i have to sort of try to take the those glasses off for a little bit and double check am i really perceiving these things accurately  or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint and i try to look for clues about that   i think im um slipping back a little bit uh uh i dont do well during unemployed periods ive noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so its easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedules too wide open for for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important it um it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone whos tends to be depressed   uh  well i dont know if its changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that um uplifting lets say uh but its more negative like i have ha have been sort of thinking about how um um soldiers in the past uh i dont know why but like the in during the roman era er era or the greeks gree ancient greeks how it wouldve been like to be in a in a frontline battle with  mm you know just crude cru kind of crude cru in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and  the i dont know i seem se my mind seems to go there a lot where im just thinking about that and ive been looking look looking at it and reading books about that or um video clips on youtube and eh things like that or um some other things thi other uh kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that  where probably shouldnt dwell so much on that  oh you mean in life in general yeah well i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was wa uh was going into depression right then and wasnt coping in my senior year very well and um didnt really i didnt get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but uh so thats very thats a big regret that i have um  i think it wouldve been to um  at certain points i probably shouldve sought so um sought therapy and also probably some uh outside help just with um getting through finals just the logistics i had i was an art major and i had no car so   a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and and also to uh meet at away locations i think it probably wouldve been worth it to   do whatever it took to get a car laughter at that time so  um  well im ive been told im very patient  and also i have um some original original artistic ideas   so  um those are those are good qualities im very loyal and and also um  you know i support my friends im fairly generous with them  so yeah  um lets see  xxx really enjoyed was i had a  i had a nice experience uh just uh photographing um a soccer game recently   i really enjoyed that so  mhm okay  it was my pleasure  thank you goodbye

yes im doing great how about you im born in the us i was born in uh orlando florida um my parents my dad had a lot of friends in los angeles so uh we decided to move here um it was pretty different i mean uh the place i was before was very it was a very small town um you probably wont even notice it um on the map um so it was a big learning experience um cause you know the schools were a lot larger and  different cultures and ethnicities um so it was a unique experience um last time ive been back was probably about five years ago um definitely different uh my aunt she lives in uh again she lives in a small town um so if you wanna go to a movie theater you have to drive out at least an hour or if you wanna go to a mall its a its an hour drive so um its complete opposite of los angeles um the convenience everything uh everything i could possibly want is here um the weather is great um shopping um multiple mult a lot of lot of friends here sports um la is just kind of like the perfect area you know  you know i wanna live here kind of for the rest of my life actually  um the big thing would probably be traffic i mean wherever you go theres gonna be traffic whether youre on the four o five or the one o one its its just traffic it it you know it can kill like two hours in your day which is huge  um yeah quite a bit for personal and for uh for business i travel um you know usually overseas or um domestically um i travel so and i enjoy it a lot um seeing different places uh different areas meeting new people um eating different kinds of food um being able to sightsee and tour um if i have a day or two free um its just experiencing um having new experiences just enriches my life um computers  um and i also did english as well yes i am um i work in it in an it department at a semiconductor company dream job um probably working for apple laughter um since i pretty much own everything they have uh yeah itd be great to work for apple um you know it depends um there are times when its good to be alone but for the most part i consider myself uh an outgoing social person  um nothing too much i guess uh if you kind of uh make a promise and you and you break it several times and i might get a little bit might get a bit a little bit uh annoyed but i dont think i would get really mad um good question id probably say um i tend to eat a little bit more um just kinda keep my mind off of it a little bit um but usually doesnt last that long so i just keep kinda like tend te i tend to eat out a little bit more more of kinda like maybe junk food or something um i think im pretty good i i rarely get mad um and if i do it doesnt really last that long um so i think im pretty good at um i guess controlling my temper um again i really dont get angry so um its not really an issue for me um id say during the elections um we were talking about uh president obama and mitt romney and you know whod be the best fit uh for for the next presidency um  that kind of got a little bit uh i guess a little bit heated but it was more for uh i guess more for fun sake than anything else but it was an interesting conversation  um like to eat out a lot uh watch movies uh play video games um just go out shop uh play sports uh watch a laker game if i can in person it would probably be the best um bowling photography um like to doing a lot i like to do a lot of different things um and of course electronics    um id say outgoing loyal um intelligent funny um and a great listener uh no i have not no no um for most nights its its pretty easy um just have to avoid drinking coffee or tea before i sleep um other than that its been pretty easy um id say a little bit sluggish tired um kind of reaction time is a little bit slower um aside from that um i think nothing too much mu like too glaring or anything um the usual just being sluggish and not moving as quickly as i should um pretty good have no complaints no pretty much the same um i guess today i had my uh car maintenance today and it didnt cost me anything so thats great and i thought it was gonna cost me you know something extra on the side but you know the uh the service advisor waived it so i got everything free today so actually im in a really good mood  hmm no nothing uh probably um dont spend as much save more money um aside from that um nothing else just be um kind of more um wise with your money um id probably say my best friend hes kind of a you know helped me out and i helped him out as well so its been uh kind of a great learning experience um you know developing our uh our friendship and hes bailed me out a couple of times i bailed him out as well so its kind of its a mutual thing we do um you know with each other um and its you know its like a great way to bond as well  hmm um id say probably going back uh back to korea um to visit my uh relatives um you know they theyre a lot more different than uh i remember you know like fifteen years ago when i was a kid i was actually kind of afraid of some of them but um now that i see them you know recently theyve actually mellowed a lot and theyre actually  pretty fun to talk to so um it was kind of a a learning experience for me because uh theyre you know they did complete one eighty from when i was a when i was a kid um i say um guess work would be part of it um  buying my uh the car that i wanted it took a couple years to save up to buy the car but i i paid it all off so i dont have any more car payments so thats great too and you know being able to help my uh family out as well  hmm um  lets see a while recently recen um a couple weeks ago i went to uh las vegas for the uh for cs um which is great if you into gadgets and electronics um you get to see all the uh the goodies coming out this year so that was uh pretty interesting to see and um some things that uh you know when you read on blogs they didnt talk about so you get to see it actually in person kind of experience it from a user standpoint so i thought it was great  um and its just fun its kind of like being a kid in a candy store you get to play with different gadgets um so it was really fun for me  yeah 
yes  good  from california  i like the eh arts and entertainments i like the uh you have a lot of freedom to work in a lot of different fields um i like the fact that the weather is great um i like the fact that all my roots are here all my family is here   i dont like how hard it is to get places anymore its very hard theres so much traffic it takes a long time to get where youre going um its expensive its a lot more expensive than it used to be   not anymore  i studied journalism english music and special effects makeup  i am  now i am managing a doggy day care facility  my dream job is to  own my own company again um probably working with animals  no im im an artist i draw i paint i do tattoos i work a lot with animals i like outdoor activities biking hiking   um people that arent fair people that are   angry and um people that are dishonest  usually i will give myself like a ten second timeout and think about it before i speak or react  im very good at controlling my temper  probably my spouse um about something to do with our financial matters  im very close to my children and my father  scrubbedentry no its never easy its the hardest job in the world but its the best  just um wanting to prevent your children from making the mistakes youve had but you realize that they have to do that just to learn how to live life um thats one of the hardest things is letting them make their own mistakes  the uh unconditional love my boys have for me the  everything that being a parent has made me a better person its made me a better everything a better employee um ive i think being having my children made me um much better person every day  probably i have a lot ive had a very full life i would be really hard to say to narrow that down ive had so many  im a good friend im a true friend im honest im real im dependable and i dont play games im very im no n im no drama    no yes i have in um  february of two thousand eleven  i was attacked by a stalker and almost killed in november of two thousand nine he broke into my apartment and laid in wait for me and attacked me when i came in the door and tried to kill me  i do  i think therapy has helped me tremendously i dont think id be able to hold a job and be responsible and be   a productive member of society s of society without therapy  im able to handle things better i dont get so um emotionally upset um a lot more rational i try to stay more rational than emotional more rational and logical  soso ive been sick and ive been uh run down a little stressed out  i have yes i have i use the resources res draw on the resources that ive learned and i reach out to other people i try not to isolate i try to um use the tools that have been given to me in therapy um i dont use medication anymore so its mainly just proactive treatment where i have to uh do something about it  its not its never easy its always bad  tired lethargic um its hard to keep my thoughts in order its hard just to do the basics during the day   mm no i cant remember oh i went to the beach with my oldest son and his best friend and we rode three real threewheel bikes and that was a lot of fun  its hard to say right now i havent decided im very proud of my children i would say thats probably it theyre really good boys  i have too many regrets right now  to finish school to um  stay focused to not  let myself get distracted um to focus more on longterm goals than shortterm goals my father  im very honest im very calm  i dont get angry easily it takes a lot to provoke me  im uh reliable if i say im gonna do something i do it  and im uh im not im basically what you see is what you get i dont i dont pull any punches with people   um anything to do with animals i love animals i always smile around animals any kind big small  um i like older people elderly people i like to help them and be around them i like children um 
synch yes good how are you i am from los angeles yes um its uh center of everything eh you can get to all the places you need to go to uh eh without having to drive very far um i like being in the city well being in la also youre dealing with traffic a lot of congestion and um obviously uh the environment as far as uh the air quality is not that great but you know you live with that um i was a business administration major so i studied business and um after i finished college i um uh pursued a career in retail operations uh no i as a matter of fact i am not i kinda changed career uh over the last four or five years so im concentrating more on the human resources side of the business um a couple of factors um i after working numerous years in the retail business i um switched over and worked in a uh creative business which was a graphic design firm and i uh captured a knowledge knowl a lot of knowledge um in the a in the human resources side because i was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a a small company yes im very happy i did that um i picked up on lot of knowledge and uh and its very helpful laughter well my dream job is um im basically kinda doing what i wanna do now because i am a uh independent contractor i do freelance work as an hr consultant using all the knowledge that i uh gained from previous jobs and um i utilize that with the flexibility to do the things i wanna do as far as personally and have the time i need to to do the things i wanna do and um obviously i worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of uh my retirement is already set in place so i do what i need to do as far as um maintaining a certain lifestyle but also i have i also enjoy what i do im not under as much stress as i used to be mm im not well im not totally outgoing but um im not im not extremely shy im probably right in the middle maybe more towards outgoing but im not totally outgoing i mean when im around other people i am uh in a social situation i i guess you could consider me an outgoing person but um obviously i do have my own little uh private issues that i keep to myself oh sure you know i have um uh couple years ago i had a heart attack and i had to have bypass operation and it had to yeah it had to do with stress and things like that i dont talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me um if i meet someone new i dont just openly say well you know ive experienced this this and this so i just basically um if it comes up i wont deny it or if it comes up and if its if it i feel like its something to talk about i will talk about it actually um my relaxation is um im currently um living with my mom my mother and uh shes a senior citizen and shes alone um so what i do for uh relaxation or to relieve stress is i actually help he help her do yard work take care of all the gardening and things like that and thats actually very uh therapeutic you know um im not um im not a shortfused kinda person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as um my tempers concerned theres not theres not much to that um im trying to think here sigh i cant recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when i um had a creditor that i was dealing with um being very difficult to work with um and i owed money as far as um some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and uh they werent very understanding of the situation and i uh i really got a little upset about that because um i felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but uh they were playing hardball and i didnt care for that it does laughter probably the hardest xxx decision i ever had to make was um it had to do with a life and death situation with my my stepfather who was battling uh prostate cancer and yeah uh making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was gonna either um help him or there was a slight chance it was gonna help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point or it would it would kill him you know um and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but uh uh you know i i felt like if i didnt try and see if we could save his life l help save his life or if it we didnt take a chance and and take that extra step that i would regret it in the long run it is it was um well right now um im separated from my wife so uh she has her issues i have my issues but we are not divorced were just separated and um we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just dont live together and the relationship with my mothers really great you know um shes very understanding im an only child so she likes having me around which is good because shes in her late shes in her later stage of her life shes eighty two years old and and so she needs to uh i guess its good that in in in its own way maybe fate has taken place because you know eh someone eighty two years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there i think she feels fe theres a comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child probably the most guilty i feel about anything are are the things that i did to hurt my marriage um as far as um the things that i did the selfish things that i did when i was much younger that um obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife uh yeah i um got caught up in a situation where um i was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lotta stress my wife was also working a lotta hours in a job that she had and uh we were growing apart and um when she was away my form of release was to go uh to the casinos and gamble and so you know i spent a lot of time in in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spent a lot of money and obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship had to do with trust because um it it was devastating to my wife i felt uh when whe when it when it came to light um i felt very guilty and i felt less than a human being at that point in my life no not at all no not really no i dont have problems sleeping thats i i dont ever recall having any problem sleeping so no no not at all no uh i well i just deep breath the only thing i could say is um after i had my heart attack a few years ago um i dont let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before so i tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that the last time i felt really happy um probably when i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack and um he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack and that um i could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medications well i guess number one thing is uh my physical being itself i like to be a little bit more healthier lose some more weight um just in general just be more healthier physically and as far as mentally um just not go back to those ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish just one day at a time you know i just uh try to be at peace with my myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis i meditate i read you know i read some books i watch tv i i do things that i know that um if i can i if i can help myself i do things to help myself well theres a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage uh my uh working career as far as i had a long career with this majors uh food chain and and i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining a a very good career but um at this point right now theres not much i can do i cant change whats been done so i dont focus too much on the past i just look at whats in front of me and just focus on whats in front of me eh every day what advice laughter wake up and see s and see what youre doing to yourself and you know make the changes that need to be changed um you know kno uh you know im not a uh im not someone thats not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know whats right from wrong and um scrubbedentry youre what youre doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately probably the proud pro what im proud about overall is the fact that um i did all these awful things but deep down i dont think as a person im a bad person i have to remember that um when i was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior it was because i had an illness a compulsive uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and um that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy and every day thats what my life is about its about recovery and uh just making sure that uh i do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night one day at a time its not as hard as you think its but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and um just know that whats not right for you you know it could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore um most of my best friends can uh describe me as probably easygoing generous um a nice person to be around and um you know they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues uh related to the gambling and the my and the breakup of breakup of my marriage which you know its still not over yet you know well my ideal weekend starts off usually um after i have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six oclock um i go to a local park and uh its about this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill its about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning um get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that i um you know go home um work in the yard a few hours take a shower and relax and then just uh kinda kick back for the rest of the day and then the the the next day i i do the same thing again in the morning i go for a walk work out in the yard watch tv whatever just relax thats how a weekend goes for me and thank you bye
synch i am i feel pretty good im wide awake i had an good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee and uh i have an easy day today so i am just gonna chat with you then im going to the gym and run some errands so i plan on having a nice day today i was born and raised in los angeles and im one of the few locals from around here and uh i went to school away and uh but im one of the few natives that are actually in los angeles yes i am i like the weather having owned a vacation house in another state that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here um i like the culture i like the diversity i like the familiarity i like that beaches uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that and uh i think its a great place to live thank you well more of some maybe some of the things i dont like about la or say california in general say like the high tax rate which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations im a small business owner so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated and uh thats a big problem here in uh uh california it really does most people dont understand it but  its uh also uh you know besides the high taxes you know theres a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people dont see that but its a big tax on the social service system and thats what makes our taxes uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of so thats you know but people dont seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things thats why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state i enjoy traveling ive been to sixty six countries and uh i dont travel as much as i used to but ive traveled quite a bit and ive learned a couple of languages and uh i served im sorry uh i didnt really understand uh your question when you said like what i dont think you understood what i said but ill just go back and ive been all through europe eastern europe asia south america north africa um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and theres warm water to surf cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and uh i try to eat healthy and uh thats a big part of my life oh sure um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though id been there about ten times we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping but really having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city and it was fun even though i grew up in la i grew up taking french which there wasnt a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger my mother insisted that all of us kids take french even though spanish wouldve been a lot more valuable but i took french uh all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school so it was nice to practice my french even though i dont remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french with the french you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me laughter so that was a uh i have a few different degrees so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate and uh that was fun and i also have a masters uh degree in economics and i have a degree in crisis management so uh i found them um interesting and uh it was something that i wanted to do where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland and i originally wanted to be a doctor but once you start going to school for a little bit you change your mind etcetera so um im actually in the wholesale business now for wholesale distributors of furniture products and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business and its pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it but its different than other jobs ive had in the past hm actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun ive changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home and uh uh i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter and uh you know didnt get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i wouldve liked but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids you know that i like doing im always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life so probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun uh i think im um generally more reserved and shy with strangers but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable i think im more of an extrovert whereas most strangers might think im more introverted but i think im when i feel comfortable with certain people and i dont know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i mightve known for years either from a personal or a business situation and be more um introverted i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved reser i use like to use the term reserved oh wow thats a great idea i used to have that on uh one of my i have uh several computers at home and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach you know maybe going surfing when the weathers warm i dont surf in cold weather anymore because it makes it gives me like a brain freeze even though ive surfed for you know over thirty years i had it uh i usually find exercise helps me relax the best or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the tv i find very relaxing laughter but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but yes that was uh that was it but thats one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills i probably didnt have them the best in my twenties but over the years i think ive gotten better uh at the i think thats a key thing and i think as we mature as we learn how to do that i wish id learned how to do that and be a little more how do you had had the skills earlier i like to think im pretty good i think im a lot better as well as that as ive aged um you know i i am more likely to think before i speak now whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought so i mightve said more things that i in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or a work situation um but ive never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it i think im a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity oh wow you know i havent really had an argument with anybody in several years y what i would consider a traditional argument um probably um my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter and it wasnt anything violent but it was heated just basically one of the reasons we didnt werent married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting and uh just uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused us to butt heads but it was just i dont know if id call it an argument but it was more of just a uh one of those lets agree to disagree butt heads so i felt like i was talking to a wall and i actually felt more mad at myself that i shouldve learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them thats the kind of discussions that people should usually have but youre not really thinking of that because sometimes when were younger were looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me but you know im pretty easy going and i have different ideas on raising children how she did and that was more not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really discussed those things but it was really just fundamental reasons why we butted heads and more werent really a good match whereas other things looked good you know on paper to both of us hm theres one recently my father passed away uh recently thank you and really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days and i really only invited very very close friends and family members i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that wouldve liked to have come tp the service had they known about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but now as times passed i wish id invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didnt invite them because i was under a time pressure but i couldve easily done it via email or its hard to call everybody personally but i wish thats something cause people have expressed a little they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didnt tell me til after the fact that you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so im not really mad at myself about something i probably shouldve been more prepared for also something s s something that was coming was inevitable so um well both my parents are recently uh deceased in the last couple of years and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away in december and were not super close like i always like i look at other families we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting i guess were also uh different and uh i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family not that its strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that we just never did that because were all all so uh uh different yeah its yeah just being thats how it is but you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybodys great you know but i think every family has their own sort of stuff um no but i thought probably i couldve had it before from some other events in my life and i just wasnt sure ive had been to some therapy in the past just from you know uh i was in the military and i was never really sure if that thats exactly what it was but i think i function pretty well but i just wasnt sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years i didnt enlist i was an officer i went to one of the service academies that um seventeen i started when after high school and i went to a service academy so its more prestige it just isnt enlisting its the hard where i went its the hardest school in america to get into i was but same age as everybody else that went there uh we did nineteen eighty three um just basically wasnt anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just we werent allowed to carry ammunition we were just our position were just shelled at the time and poison gas was sprayed on us so that was a it wasnt it wasnt anything too uh too intense it was a lot you know because it the service i was in the training was way more intense than any actual combat situation thats because they train you well its like you practice harder than you play if youre an athlete if you play football you practice harder than you you actually play in the game and the same with uh you know if youre in a combat unit well it made me more patriotic having grown up in california whereas people who are from all over the country and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i ended up becoming uh just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country whereas you really dont grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or georgia north dakota south dakota montana grows up with that kind of uh pride so i thought it was good and it unlike so many of my friends that they dont know any theres any life between malibu and manhattan uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school and i got two graduate degrees and i went to work in private enterprise uh didnt care for it then i joined the fire department i was a fire fighter and paramedic for a number of years and then after i got divorced it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in a family business and thats pretty much my career in a nutshell um at first it was because i had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked and again i was an officer uh you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder took me awhile to be able to come back to los angeles uh because it was just so uh so different i think i handled it better than most i have a stronger personality so but it was a great experience um it all depends if i exercise regularly and i dont eat too late and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night um but i generally sleep uh i generally sleep pretty well i feel pretty good lately you know ive been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but boy the last few months i feel great pretty much no not really i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately um ive had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it and you know it wasnt anything real too debilitating and i wasnt able to really function on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling i do i was really against it in the past and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think its very useful however in the past i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think its a useful tool if youre open to it oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about life relationships and sometimes its good talking things out with a a professional even though i wouldnt see someone like you in real life i prefer someone whos older than i am a little more life experience than someone whos maybe younger so but yeah i think its a useful tool and i really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that uh i dont go now im sorta taking a break from it but im not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off i do have someone that i go to yeah i think its nice you know they really if you go to someone whos good and again ive been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped they really dont tell you what to think which i think is great you know thats always in the past they just help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity to the situation thats why i like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man so but its um i think its a a useful tool i got some good ideas and was able to its nice balancing some things off totally someone whos unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good uh this morning i know this this is weird but im clearly someone and id say this as a joke to my friends and family and associates i clearly have im having an easy day today cause i knew were having nice weather and i have a bunch of errands to run and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know its gonna be eighty degrees out and when the weathers nice im generally a lot more happier than when the weathers laughter dark and blue and rainy and cold where i always i know that term so but im just well i woke up really happy today because i knew its gonna be a nice day and i looked forward to feeling the sun so uh most of my friends im sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects im too smart for my own good and im a i know a a lot a lot of permeable things im pretty rational im very resourceful people always call me when they have issues and i help talk them through it or im resourceful and tell them where to go whether its where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or you know im great with medical diagnoses uh and uh you know people also say im a lot of fun im fun to be with and um i also have i dont have a lot of grey areas people will either really like me or dont like me with me things are pretty much black and white i am what i am i dont bs you know im the opposite of a politician so i dont tell people what they want to hear i dont be rude not rude to anybody but i pretty much call things as i see them so thats pretty much no not really cause i do everything tactfully i like to think i do uh probably just i probably spent more time with my parents before they passed but i was busy uh i probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger uh but just a lot of its very typical really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive or have pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now i think thats thats it and i would look at things in the long term instead of looking in things in the short term you know when you make decisions or choices um im proud of my daughter shes a nice young lady i am uh proud of my public service ive never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service um there are very few people like me who did it who are as had the background in education that i did but i like public service and um so im proud of uh that  proud of all the certificates i have hanging on my walls at home and degrees sort of like trophies im proud that ive been able to stay in good physical shape over the years and knock wood maintain good health it was nice meeting you bye bye thank you
synch sure im doing alright new jersey yes three months ago not very often uh its much different uh i dont know its just laughter its a lot more crowded here to start a new life for myself it wasnt very easy at all sigh uh it was uh it was quite rough at first but you know im still trying to get used to life here ive met some good friends here um you know i love the hollywood area um and just you know the mountains are beautiful thats kinda things i love hmm the traffic not really no i dont just havent had the time or the finances to digital media well ive always loved you know deep breath computers and you know designing things and uh i dont know i just kinda fell into it no i dropped out well i i guess my dream job would be working deep breath in something that uh i went to school for you know i i never really completed my education um but i guess itd be great if i went you know back to school and you know finished you know my degree in digital media and uh you know finished and uh started working you know doing something in that field a little bit of both you know i i can be shy at times but i like to push myself to be outgoing you know its kind of a a struggle for me but i i dont wanna be you know in a shell so i kinda force myself to be outgoing listen to music i uh sometimes just drive and um you know play music in my car and that helps me relax or i smoke a cigarette oh like what ooh um laughter just heavy metal thats all i listen to is metal well sigh it depends on how high my stress level is and how angry i am but i i do my best to not get so pissed off laughter scrubbedentry and i dont know she um she wanted me to to come and pick her up uh she was a little drunk and uh we just kinda fought over the phone all over some other things and i just ended not picking her up because of her attitude on the phone with me laughter yeah it does something i feel guilty about is uh not talking to my kids uh often or as often as i should ive just been so busy with trying to get myself all situated here that i i dont really have time to you know talk to my kids as much as id like to you have no idea um its it comes natural but its no way easy and uh its its the hardest job that i love to do but right now its extremely difficult for me because they live so far away and i i made this choice to come out here to la and i feel bad that i dont see them you know but the reason i came out here was to better myself so i can provide for them fear you know fear f just fear will you know you y you fear whats gonna happen to your kids you fear that something awful is gonna happen and not seeing them it brings about that fear a lot more you know and i cant i cant always be there with them i cant see them you know it it wasnt as bad when i was living in florida um and i i at least i used to see them it wasnt very often but i used to used to see them now i dont see them at all and thats the thats the hardest thing ive had to do as a parent is to step away from my kids if only temporarily i dont know how long im gonna be here for i dont know what my future holds but the hardest thing is being so far away from them just the the joy that they bring to me i mean i could be having a bad day and they just cheer me right up i mean i eh it sucks being away from them for for so long and theyre so far away and just not seeing their faces thats its its the worst thing ever you know but i i love to just see their faces they they just bring a smile to my face and um i dont know well um i think the fact that i can get down to their level um im im a bit goofier laughter as a father than my dad was with me my dad was you know strict all the time sure he used to you know laugh and play with us but you know he was always very reserved you know and he kinda held back a lot he a lot of his emotions just because you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy um but with me i i im very goofy and silly with my kids and im strict when i have to be but i always love to you know play around with them as much as possible you know not i dont want them to grow up too fast and that that may have been yeah well sigh a situation that i wish i wouldve handled differently theres so many laughter uh i guess when i was still with my exwife in florida i wish i wouldnt have gotten so angry or i wish i wouldnt have let her get the best of my emotions she had a tendency to get underneath my skin and uh you know keep picking at me until i exploded and i allowed her to do that you know i i shouldve just walked away when i could and um you know not let my temper get the best of me no no no uh sometimes its hard um sometimes i just lay awake in bed sigh you know thinking all the things that are going through my head all the you know all the stress that im going through with work and you know making sure you know wondering if im gonna if im gonna be able to make you know rent you know wondering what my kids are going through you know when ill see them again if they even care about me anymore if they even know they have a father you know those are some of the things that run through my head and and that keeps me up at night sometimes a little sigh but sigh you know i put myself in this situation so you know i i gotta bear with it you know i gotta you know you reap what you sow so i sigh i gotta deal with it in my own way lately um ive been trying to not think so much about you know all thats going into my life uh i try to distract myself and that kind of gets me in a better mood you know if im hanging out with friends or just watch a little tv something to get my mind off you know all the stresses in my life um the last time i felt really happy uh was actually a couple of nights ago i went out drinking with um with a couple of my friends from work and um i dont know we just got pretty drunk and just laughter that kinda helped me to forget all the crap that was previously going through my head so if if i can distract myself if i can forget about all that other stuff then im happy sigh some of my best qualities i guess that im convincing laughter um uh im kind of like a i guess you would say a counselor to some people you know some of my close friends you know i may talk people into doing things that they may regret or i may i mean im sorry take talk people out of things that they you know may end up regretting or i may um you know just listen to people so you know eh i could say that you know i definitely you know listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need when theyre going through something troubling times like like im going through scrubbedentry uh who lives in florida you know i talk to him every now and then and hes been having troubles with his girlfriend and you know i just kind of talk to him about his problems and listen i mostly mo i mainly listen because you know i dont think he has anybody else to listen to you know when i was living in florida i was uh very close with him so you know he hed always relied on me and now that im here in la i dont wanna lose that you know connection with him because i mean ive always been there for him so he um he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice you know about what i think you know he should do um so i think th i think he appreciates that and i and im glad that he you know relies on me for that uh he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff laughter i dont know sigh um sometimes i wish i wasnt so kind or generous it seems bad but sometimes i i dont know people may take advantage of me and i may not realize it and um i dont like saying no to people i like to always please people so if i can change that maybe i wish i wasnt such a people pleaser sometimes financially in trouble laughter deep breath sometimes i you know it you know help others and not you know that may make me broke sometimes yeah i may not have enough to pay bills but i feel better helping people i dont know i regret not breaking up with my exwife sooner i regret re i regret re because she put me through so much crap in my life and um i was always trying to be a people pleaser i was trying to please her you know trying to please my kids as much as i can by not breaking up you know the family but you know theres only so much one person can take and i i think probably if i wouldve left sooner i may have been happier and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did you know during all those years with her so maybe if i wouldve got out sooner i dont know i wouldve been happier i guess um its okay to be selfish its okay to you know think about yourself sometimes you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you then youre not thinking about yourself youre not thinking about what makes you happy and even though pleasing people may make you happy uh you have to think about yourself sometimes too and about your needs because you know you play an important role in the lives of your close family members and um in order to keep everything afloat you sometimes gotta xxx gotta worry about the one person thats you know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so be a little selfish sometimes its okay laughter i dont even know what a weekend is anymore my ideal weekend would be locked away alone in my room watching movies listening to music just with my cell phone off and not you know being with anybody or it could be out at a bar you know or you know watching a a metal show so i like to be alone but at times i i do wanna be out with uh with others i like you know being around people crazy laughter he thinks im uh im crazy for coming out here but i guess he would say that im dedicated and that im strongminded and that you know whatever i set my mind to i can do it you know no matter how hard it is im not gonna wimp out so i mean i i really respect him for giving me his insight but uh i guess yeah i guess he would say that im crazy but strongminded laughter my kids sigh you know thats the one thing that brings joy to me you know like real real joy are my kids and you know just having them in my life is is the proudest thing i can ever accomplish is just you know having them in my life and although i dont get to see them as much even e even when i think about them just thinking about you know how far theyve gone you know what what theyve accomplished in their you know in in their short time i mean eh yeah it makes me happy and i cant wait to see them again one of my most memorable experiences i guess that would be scrubbedentry in florida you know going to see our uh you know our favorite band skeleton witch it was it was a great night overall you know one of the nights ill never forget just because wed been looking forward to it for you know so many months and you know when it finally happened it was surreal um it was it was a great night after all and overall sure youre welcome bye

just exploring uh exploring exp exploring new places um seeing new things meeting new people a different culture its definitely um um gives you an appreciation for life and the diversity of it and also um going to countries that may not be as developed as the us it definitely it definitely gives you a greater appreciation of you know this country yeah okay well sigh uh lets see london i accident actually when i first heard about going to london i really didnt care for it cause i didnt know much about it the only i thing i remember mem i remember is watching mary poppins laughter and um but um when i went there i absolutely fell in love with it um just deep breath it still sti it has the hustle and bustle of la but at the same time you can go at a very very slow pace um we didnt

have no idea laughter um good question ive always ive always wanted to go into business um and ive always wanted to study finance but i didnt think i would learn too much about finance from college per se i think ive learned more in the real world whatnot so the other option was human resource and im always fascinated about you know relationships and people always like reading articles about that stuff so i went for that no laughter well i still i still kinda use what ive learned but i i work in property management so um it still has to do with people anything to do with people im fascinated about so yeah laughter that was a good one um my dream job wow i would say being a life coach i would uh yeah i would say that would my dream job because i love helping people become

laughter right sigh to relax i usually listen to music i usually listen to music to relax me or i pray to to relax myself or listen to some really calm music so yeah very good very very good i used to uh i wouldnt say it was a bad temper but i was known to um go off quote on quote laughter not in a not in a you know not throwing chairs or anything like that but im a very very patient person but once that patience patien is gone and for you to do that you have to really really really really push my buttons for a long time and once its done i i just go off no mm mm no sigh the last time i argued with someone some wow i havent argued with somebody in a long time um sigh boy mm uh i argued with my no i would say my i think it my dad i argued with him um about sigh xxx what was it about um we were disagreeing on some things about when we were gonna supposed to go back to nigeria and he wasnt listening to it was a kind of like a group discussion myself and my my siblings and he was being very subjective he wasnt being open to other peoples suggestions and suggestions and concerns so um it started an argument uh very uh i wouldnt say angry per se but i felt very kinda like i was losing control like um im the type where i i like to be in control of my emotions and of my thoughts and i feel once that patience is gone and i start going off its kinda like this this uh you know i wont call it a blur but im very witty and quick with what i say so i will instantly say something that you know up not necessarily hurtful but um very direct and to the point and i make sure i get my point across yeah um i have three brothers one one younger two older im very close with my family and my mom is one of my best friends um sigh my brothers are great um love em to death uh my father eh hes moreso out of the picture yeah deep breath hmm sigh i dont i dont really im not the guilty type laughter i dont feel guilty im not one to shy away from what ive done and i definitely own up to what i do im not one to shy away from responsibility but i dont think i ever feel guilty for anything i do yeah i dont think i feel i i usually dont feel guilty yeah deep breath pretty pretty easy um pretty easy at a at yeah im pretty good at falling asleep except when im excited and when im reading laughter when im trying to when im when im focused on learning something like ill read and read and read even when its past my bed time but now im trying to work on waking up much earlier then when i am now and thats kind of a struggle st a little bit of a struggle but im getting to it so good um ive been feeling ive been feeling fine you know im generally i have a very very happy disposition and so no uh you know deep depressing moods nothing like that and whenever if i feel do feel like im going i dont allow myself to go to that place nah no sorry sigh mm sigh thoughts i would say well we its i wouldnt say necessarily changes but id say moreso behaviors learning how to let go of past decisions maybe and kinda how they they played their course in my life um i just sometimes i kinda look back and say what if i did this what wouldve how would life be now no so the those are some games i play but other than that thats it hmm laughter regret uh no no mm mm there isnt anything i regret sigh ten to twenty years ago i would say dont be afraid of who you are um be authentic um more importantly with yourself hmm erase from my memory uh boy thats a good one sigh hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm uh wow erase from my memory uh i would say when i told t when i told my dad that he should act like a father maybe i shouldnt yeah there was um that was actually one of the times i laughter another time i went off usually with him um uh basically i had decided not to go to a private um not to go away for college um so s i went we i decided to stay local so i can look after my little brother and um sigh my senior year i was overloading with everything i had maybe like uh four ap classes i was working at i was working three jobs at the time and i was also in track and field so needless to say i was laughter i i i i was kinda like burning myself i was kinda like burning myself out and um i wasnt doing well in ap calculus because i decided to go to a jc first and transfer also to save money for college too and when i told him you know the teacher called saying i was falling asleep in class um just because mind you after school id work an eight hour shift cause i was a retail manager at the time so um and id come home after that shift to do homework mm calculus let alone um so uh um he would get upset and i told him i spoke with my counselor i already told him that i dont need that class to go to the jc isnt something that i continue with so im just gonna i cant drop out at that point in time so im just gonna you know you know just just take the d or fail whatever and he didnt he didnt like that cause he is a teacher laughter i think maybe thats what maybe where it came from hes a teacher as well um and so he started blaming like my jobs and wanting to call my boss and it was it was just too much and i told him you know since youre my father you should act like it but i was it was a more aggressive laughter way i said it so that was um one thing oh i actually i do i i do remember i do regret one thing um and that is i wish i continued um with college throughout like i i burnt myself out um i was spreading myself too thin there was actually i was actually on track to graduate from college at i wanna say nineteen cause i started taking college classes in high school starting sophomore year in high school but i with that that stuff and the stuff with my dad and working i just kinda like stopped going to school for a while and just worked but i went back to

trait yeah wish i was taller laughter um uh besides my height hmm i wish ah maybe i dont know if its uh be more i wont say be more in touch with my emotions but i think i would say understanding peoples how people feel about me in their shoes i think that would be one thing because im the type of person where people say that they love me or care about me and im like okay great thank you i appreciate that but i dont realize how much they do i think thats a realizing how much they care and love me thats one thing i would like to get more of a grasp on laughter my best friend deep breath

has a very different kind of um attitude i guess and so its a little difficult but i but ive gotten more used to it since ive been here uh not at all um when i left things got things were sort of i i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um to be with uh some people who were gonna help me out and im just sort of i dont know if estranged is the right word but im just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often its not easy its its kind of um i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job um i miss um some friends um i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so its difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot um i feel like i failed and now im here and i cant seem to get back on my feet so its its its hard depends on the situation i think im outgoing when im comfortable um and then im extremely outgoing but when im in a situation im not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy so that doesnt really answer your question but um clears throat i have certain i do i do a lot of writing um i have certain music that i listen to as im writing and when i can when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really um it can it soothes me its like its when i feel most relaxed i guess um a few weeks ago i guess i was id been working on a book on a on a on a novel and when i was really when i was really getting into writing it and um it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed um it was about a guy who is searching for something its its uh its his last day on earth and so hes going to find a person that he that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because sort of uh its sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing well ive always ive always been a writer part of the reason i came to la was because of screenwriting um so i wrote some screenplays and uh you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then ive kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and ive started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so i ive been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to to really hit me its not easy the exhale the parts the parts when its good its really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i hate it because its so difficult um but its worth it for the times when its when its good good i dont i dont really have a temper i its not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people um if something is really really stressful or if im in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can lose it but i probably prob thats probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much try to it when im upset i i get upset with myself not with other people um last night i guess well weh um i got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because id already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i i ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasnt a blow up argument but it was a definite argument um uh a lot so much um uh i i i was in uh a relationship that i really really um that i really wanted to work and uh i ended up and it was partly due to i hadnt i was on i wasnt on the right medication and so i was going at like everything sort of spiraled out of control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasnt i wasnt mean but i was but i was getting more and more messed up and i couldnt stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so that was pretty that was pretty tough well some of it was was that i wasnt medicated properly i mean now ive been to a doctor and im on medication thats completely kind of i mean i still get i still get upset and i still get depressed but its not like it was its not i dont completely lose it for days at a time um so i mean i know theres a part of me that knows logically that it wasnt all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i wouldve then it wouldve probably be different if i was who i am now then i wouldve i would i would be i would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldnt have but i mean i could have i dont know i dont know if i couldve done anything different things being how they were i mean its its possible uh i mean obviously yeah because i mean thats what i do i i take little things thin i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff um and its like any little detail that comes up i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still i still get i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school which was years and years ago which i shouldnt even be thinking about anymore cause its so in the past but i still get that feeling like im right back there well its its not easy ive been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way um but you know since the medication its been better it hasnt been impossible to deal with it hasnt been easy but its but its been better um well like i said i do a lot of you know if im if im writing or if im doing anything like i kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely um if im watching tv i have to be playing a game on my phone if im using im the computer i have to be you know watching a tv show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just keep my mind occupied during all of that um i just need i mean i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i cant yet theyre triggered by everything pretty much anything that i that i see if i if i if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about just anything you know i can reach back and connect to to this its really its really i dont know thats the thing i mean i dont ever get a break from it yeah um i dont know im a very light sleeper so i awake and asleep and awake and asleep asl i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally you know dont i dont know i never really needed much sleep so its just only recently that ive really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work um but now its its its like if i do that i cant i still dont get enough sleep i dont conk out i still just sleep very lightly you know i get up i toss and turn all night you know and now its just its yeah i dont sleep too great right now um pretty i mean i dont know its hard to its hard to know i i usually just kind of power through it and just im uh im like how i am now just i just feel bad um i think about three three four years ago um it was when i i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for for years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said youve actually got this situation and we need to get you on the medication that youre on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything uh went bad so i dont know in the moment i dont know i dont really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that im that i had to that i i lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldnt control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me werent helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasnt it was it didnt help it didnt work until until you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so im im like thanks guys for helping but it was a little its a little late now um there really wasnt any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was it was either i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but it was at least that and not firing me but but but yeah but so i got help but it was but it wasnt soon enough uh not not as much as i should um i go to a couple of meetings i go to i go to aa so that i can um you know keep control of that aspect too t too and theres a theres a therapy aspect to that um unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know im im you know im getting my medication from the city of la so you know im not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but its really very ive ive only seen her three times in the past year so its basically to keep my medication coming and then theres you laughter right well like i said i mean just the talk tah i mean the the lets just take the aa for example because thats probably the closest cloth closest for that im seeing with therapy for now um just saying stuff outloud is just like getting getting this stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess thats in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who youre saying it to whether its a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean youre youre taking all that stuff thats thats really been killing you and youre making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing yeah um you know better than i than i have been um i mean it it sort of it goes g it has its ups and downs um you know im applying for jobs five six jobs or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to to to being self sufficient again um its hard but thats like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now its just i have to deal with real life which is it just has its its just its own own challenge yeah um it was probably you know a couple years ago um i i was i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind uh is everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a christmas tree and we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebodys life and feeling like a part of the bigger the bigger life thats thats out there you know like what normal people feel you know for that instant i felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and i mean it wasnt going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person a normal happy person and part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that i dont know if ill ever feel that again so um probably the probably this educational educary educational series i did uh an educational uh video series i did for the national science foundation um it was it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and you know im hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to the world oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas uh for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest project that the nsf had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it right that doesnt yeah um i guess grunt i dont know laughter uh i dont know its been a its been a while since ive really thought about that i dont know would i go somewhere would i i i i dont know thank you
synch sniffle yeah im okay with it um im okay im okay um i guess scrubbedentry im basically an la kinda guy cool um you know the weather its usually pretty sunny and and temperate you know i like the the climate really a lot uh i like the girls here you know um i like uh lets see i dont like the traffic you know but um i like the hispanic population quite a bit you know um and i have a lot of friends here so i guess you know i dont wanna be anywhere else i mean like i said the traffic you know i was on the four o five you know thats always kinda you know crummy the cost of living thats really you know terrible about la its always expensive and um you know i really dont like sigh i really dont like you know the the like it just seems like um las one of those places where like youre you know you either have like a a you know a ton of money and fame and fortune or like you know youre down in the you know the ghettos you know i have ive been to a couple places um uh you know but very brief you know mostly it was for school um i went to arizona and new york and montana lot of the anthropology like you know and archaeology field trips and things like that um nothing im doing in right now uh i like getting away from um laughter the city you know i was in yosemite last year you know in the summer for vacation that was kinda nice you know yosemite was really um really neat to see but uh just basically getting away from the city i guess you know getting away from the job getting away from um the stress here uh i actually studied political science and i also studied economics um im a big kind of a political you know junkie you know to begin with so i naturally kinda fell in line with that kinda field of study i was i was but i lost my job and you know thats kind of a bummer you know um i lost its uh geez its already been maybe a year and a half by now maybe two years and um you know the economy uh got bad and the budget cuts got bad and you know um i wish i was working there again uh laughter well i um wanted to be a lawyer at one time i wanted to be a lawyer and i um and thats why i took political science and i took a double major in economics and uh the sad thing is the sad thing i i regret is i eh you know to get into law school you have to take this entrance exam called the lsats and i studied for it like really hardcore you know for about a year and i took the xxx test and like a idiot um i didnt feel right about the that day it was kind of an off day and you know it was like you know the big game at the superbowl you y you know i just um i dont do i dont feel like i did well and i canceled the test and so um you know i kinda regret that you know laughter tell me about it um im not really shy at all im definitely not shy um but outgoing i mean not one of these people peo im not flamboyent you know um i ill talk to people i dont mind talking to people i dont mind um meeting mee meeting people thats fine with me but its not like im you know dying to to dying to meet anybody laughter you know laughter i guess um these days uh you know i play guitar you know i taught myself how to play guitar um uh yeah thank you thank you i you know i i shouldve i should actually be doing more of it but i also like to exercise um uh im on a diet right now but my diets been terrible time the eating habits have been terrible but the exercise part is just great i love to exercise exerci i love to run thats one of my best things to do for stress is like run and like work out um i just wish that my eating habits were were in line uh or a little bit better you know sniffle um sigh my temper could be you know definitely improved uh a lot you know um you know a lotta times i i feel im one of these introvert types persons when it comes to like you know i dont mind being extrovert or like meeting people and like having a good time whatever when uh when im mad i really dont wanna be you know talking to people i dont like to yell i dont like to scream i dont like to hit i dont like to fight i kinda close down a lot i dont i just wanna be left alone sometimes i tend to drag it on for longer than it should be you know uh the wife doesnt like it too much and maybe i you know i just dont i just dont wanna talk about it laughter i just dont wanna deal with it i kinda close down and shut you know shut off for a little bit geez um you know it doesnt happen too often maybe with my wife you know we were probably something silly who knows who knows um the thing i i mean i dont have a lotta guilt i dont do anything like to make me ever feel like you know that bad of a person you know um there are things that like you know um i call minor sins you know i get white lies or whatever you know but like nothing like so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty um lets see i guess sometimes you know um you know i im a married guy but i you know sometimes there are times you know i like to you know smile at a girl or like you know get a girls attention you know i dont know i never go i never do anything about it i never get their phone number or like you know but sometimes i like to like talk to people i guess you know well thats a good question i guess i guess you know see i always handle it the same theres not i dont ever wish to ever to ever change i i never wanna like handle things differently i always kinda im pretty comfortable the way i handle things and you know i think that um i could be a lot worse and like you know shouting and screaming and hitting and this and that and thats just not me um you know i think the best thing to do you know is kinda like get a lot of breathing room a lotta space and um i dont wish for that to change or to handle any of that differently i just dont basically know what else to do you know um and you know the last thing i wanna do is start talking about you know feelings or any of this you know thats the last thing i wanna do and so like i dont wish that i handle things like that differently in that way well um you know im pretty happy with my family right now um you know if im married and we have a baby along the way which is kinda nice um we have some cats thank you thank you we have cats and a dog a weenie dog and um my mom i i love my mom dearly um uh she has diabetes which you know she doesnt control you know she doesnt control it and like it like uh it affects her health and it always has me worried about her and like stressing out about her and and she could do so much to like prevent it and she doesnt and um you know i have a good relationship with my mom i i love her dear dearly and i actually have a good relationship with everybody i think i think i have a ton to ton of of family and friends um that get along with me pretty well actually you know yeah um sigh there are times well i mean its pretty easy for me to go to sleep actually i i feel like you know i sleep like a baby um the only problem i have i think is i feel like um you know sometimes like you fall asleep and you have you youre just going to sleep and you kinda like jolt you know like you almost kinda like fall eh its like a falling sensation or something like that and it doesnt happen eh that often but it happens and um but for the most time ti part um no i sleep like a rock i sleep really good sniffle well right now generally ive been feeling um worried and and anxious and um you know uh and tense and the reason why is cause i said my mom um right well at least today well i found out my mom something she didnt tell me the whole story and im kinda waiting til this is over so we can i can find out whats wrong with her but um you know im worried about her shes in the hospital ho shes in the doctors right now so that doesnt tell me anything good and um you know um trying to find a job so that has me worried too and you know the baby along the way so that has me worried so i feel like sharp inhale you know overwhelmed with a just a lotta like you know things to do and like and um a lot on my a lot on my plate and like a lot of it doesnt have anything to do with me but i have to handle it like you know so like i guess well um i keep myself distracted i keep myself busy i i feel like a busybody you know and the more um which kinda seems se you know seems like its not a good thing because i feel like im just adding more things on my plate so um you know like one of the things i do is like exercise and so i have to work out every day you know but that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know change ch change and you just start running and like go through the whole thing of stretching and and cooling down that takes it takes some time and then like to shower all that kinda stuff takes ta takes time so but i have to do it daily so i cope with it in that way i also cope with it too you know playing guitar but that just more of a distraction you know what i mean keeping you know keeping busy that way it just seems like its not you know um working towards you know the goals you know that i need to do like you know finding f finding a job which i should be doing but then um you know its one of those things where like i find like theres no good jobs ive been looking and looking and like sometimes when i do it it its just not what i wanna do it just doesnt seem like laughter like i wanna like uh do any of these like terrible jobs i xxx its you know its its probably harder than im thinking about it because sometimes i i i feel like um you know one of these things is like uh i feel like um it is hard but its not i mean there are ways i can cope with it you know i just gotta kinda i kind of accepted it a lot you know i kinda internalized it and like uh you know its not something thats like im not out on the streets or anything like that laughter but uh you know it is a worry ive never been diagnosed with ptsd i used to work with no no grumble man sigh uh ten years ago laughter i dont know uh lets see the last time i was really happy maybe i mean nothing i feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know um i learned a new song on the guitar feel fe i i feel like not even happy about that you know i feel like um you know i work sometimes and that kinda makes me happy you know running like you know fast and working out but that doesnt make me so excited or anything like that it just makes me feel good you know so i i have these these these times where im just you know feeling good about myself and im feeling you know but im never feeling great im never feeling happy im never feeling like so sensationalized like you know and and and uh you know incredible that you know um it just eh you know theres these theres these mild times where theres a a few good times you know and a few bad times but the good times are no never n never ne never extremes you know never really good times and never really you know atrocious bad times you know well i wish this diet would work out a little bit better you know but thats kinda hard you know cause im the kinda guy who just likes who just likes you know um you know rice and and like uh mexican food and like sharp inhale you know um and to snack and uh i dont know um i just feel like that could i could change i wish i could change my eating habits that way i can like you know cause i work out so much i feel like i do so much running and so much activity that like um you know that if i got my you know diet in check um you know that that would um go a long way um i wish i also can change you know um my m my my uh i guess my my desire to like you know get ahead like right now i feel just so um like the economys so bad and like things are so um rough that you know its like pointless to even like you know look for these kinda jobs so like it just seems like i just wish i had a little bit more inspiration a lot more motivation to like to um laughter sigh do things sniffle the one thing i regret is is not is not um you know is this this lsat thing you know um you know not uh uh canceling the test to begin with cause im sure i couldve got into a a school but then again like you know it has me thinking like do i really wanna pay a bunch of like you know law school tuition and the cost of that and like you know just to um just to be piled on with more work and things like that eh i dont know sigh it just doesnt seem like like uh i mean there is a this idea of justice and and um and republicanism and you know things that i really you know adhere to that um i fall in love with and that i dont wanna get away from but it just seems like its a like its a ton of work and money and just to like um it for the smalls percentage of success that that you know you might not be really doing that kinda field you might you know i might mi it just doesnt seem like like um its worth overcoming the obstacles i need to overcome ugh sigh i have no idea i would laughter i would wou twenty years ago i would tell myself maybe um you know i think ive done everything really well for myself except for the the lsat thing you know which i i you know regret on one hand on the other hand you know i im not sure if i regret cause like eh about the bills and all that kinda stuff i told you about and you know i think uh you know i ive waited to get married i waited to have a kid ive ive you know pretty cautious about the decisions deci you know i dont take drugs i dont drink i dont fight i dont do any of these like things that like you know that i think that real people have you know um and then they they really like you know ruin their life you know so like im pretty happy and content with being you know the cautious you know uh sigh i dont know oh my best friend i think he he kinda like li he likes me he wishes that i would do more things with him but he works at night and and you know its one of those things i think most people not just my best friend but my wife and might be but rest of my family feel that i dont put a lot of time and attention to them i mean they think that im pretty great when i do give em the my time of day and my attention but um i dont know if im really there all the time you know i dont know if im really you know im always thinking about something else im always thinking about something different i dont don i dont know if i really can give em eh a a real you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you know ill ill usually do it you know but i almost feel like its like a chore like you know like if they you know if they really need me then ill do it you know eh if theyre just asking for a favor i almost feel you know i do it half you know with a lotta lackluster lotta halfheartedness i just feel f and its not because i hate em or anything i really like em its just that i feel like i almost i dont wanna say i owe it to them but the mere fact that im their friend makes them somehow um you know uh like i eh it it makes me like you know they rely on me some you know times or like i dont wanna let em down they are my friends but its the same time i i just feel like its its more its not its not its more of like a chore to do instead of a a willingness like a oh my god like i just wanna help you its never ne its never like that its just something that i do because i have ha kinda have to you know you gotta you know gotta do things for your friends you know in the end because theyre your friends you know and i in in the end i do like em and they probably would do it for me and i you know so i just do these things you know just um well there are a couple a things that i do like uh that ive good go i feel good about myself you know um you know i ran the la marathon that kinda feels good you know ive graduated from college that kinda feels good you know what i mean but the thing is i dont feel like like that proud of myself for you know those things alone like graduating from college you know hasnt really made me successful you know what i mean um running the marathon hasnt made me thin and trim so theyre like half merits you know or like theyre theyre great you know lotta people maybe not half done it a lotta people have excelled further but um you know theyre kinda like stepping stones that like that um ive seal real new no life l lifelong benefit from doing other than the fact that i can say that ive done yeah yeah no problem no problem thank you for your time you know um hope you enjoy you know uh being in this computer laughter oh goodbye im gonna press this button now

to work harder laughter yeah um super happy was uh when the doctor told me i was pregnant you know i was really really happy about that and i was just like ah you know laughter that was really really good you know very excited and just reading about whats going on with my body and whats going on with the baby and oh thats very overwhelming and its scary at the same time laughter ive never really like uh you know but yeah ive yeah very happy uh um i dont know um i guess just me myself i uh you know like you know i could you know just be myself and thats it you know just i cant really you know say i have specific thing i guess i mean it depends on the person that meets me to tell me i cant really tell myself like oh im this im that just you know just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people to tell me or you know compliment me or what not yeah um laughter nothing i think laughter um like i said im im happy with the person i am right now and you know my flaws or whatever you know i might have whatever flaw people see in me and itts okay you know im okay with it whatever it just im not gonna im i cant change myself for the likings of other people laughter i have only one body and one life so yeah yeah thats it uh just my childhood with my sisters and my family but you know its you know i you learn from that you learn from the past and you kind of feel like hey you know maybe i should be a better role model you know for my children and so my children could be better role models so the world could just improve um just smile and be happy you know and whatever hard things happen you know youre gonna get through them eventually you know the only thing you cant um i dont know you cant you know go back on is death you know you could you know the heartbreak or its whatever but you know as long as im alive im just i still gotta keep going yeah laughter um i dont know um thats pretty huh most proud of i guess that im trying my best to be the best i could be and thats pretty powerful you know i im you know i try to be you know a better person each day and try to like you know improve myself every day as much as i can you know that would probably be something i could be super proud of you know as much as i can very hard laughter im not gonna lie um it is really hard you know cause i cant say you know its easy to be bad but its hard to be good you know and you know its its always challenges and everything that goes you know in your life but you know its just its its sometimes you know hard you know and sometimes it comes easy you know after a while you get a lot of practice and everythings just like you have a great day and you didnt even try laughter you know so yeah um you know loving friendly um outgoing you know adventurous i guess i dont know i guess thats what they say laughter i i just you know thats them like you know but thats what at least what i try to be you know at least i try to give a the best foot forward always as much as possible you know even sometimes even if im having a rough day im just like uh you know you know i just i dont wanna take it out on anyone or anything you know yeah um laughter my ideal weekend usually i i like going to the park i like sitting down in like a tree under a tree actually under a tree where theres shade and just kind of like put my blanket out there have my dog and like read a book and you know sometimes if i dont have my dog like theres little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them so thats pretty neat you know just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise n noise i guess cause theres not silence you know the wind and the cars and you know its just its really neat yeah awesome thank you youre welcome laughter bye
synch yeah im doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you uh im from here in la i grew up in the san fernando valley yeah uh sigh well i i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like um the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i i did a lot of hiking um camping is pretty close by ive gone snowboarding um i like eh the familiarity i think and you know its its a big city and uh you know im pretty familiar with it having lived here for so long that that i i i would say i like that too laughter probably the number one thing that everybody says i dont like traffic i dont like being stuck in traffic i dont like deep breath uh the long commutes even you know for short distances um and then you know it gets really hot in the summer at times so you know that eh i could stand it being a little lit slightly cooler when it gets to its peak peak heat but thats fine wow my dream job uh sigh thats a great question i laughter i think my dream job would probably be uh you know maybe being able to travel and somehow make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but thats almost an unrealistic dream since i dont know if i would actually wanna do that but if if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun well i like like i mentioned what i like about la i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seeing different ways of life uh would be eh is what i like about traveling um i i like experiencing new things um i think that would be nice you know despite the fact that i said i like the familiarity of la theres also fun in discovering new things so i i think travel tr when i travel thats thats what i like to do just check new things out um so i would like to be you know laughter if i could make a living doing that that would be great uh one of my trips okay well lets see the the last trip i i took um lemmi think of one on one one more exciting trip um well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was fourteen was i i went to um austria hungary and romania and uh you know getting to see some of those old castles ca id been a few times before but i it was when i was little so i dont really have too much memory plus i didnt really process things quite the same as when i was kinda more of age so i got to see you know my familys old uh you know hometown you know uh we have a family um like tomb so i got to see that then just these old buildings and just the different way of life i i i really liked that uh you know seeing my parents old friends um you know and so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year um so it was just like going from you know suburban america to traveling around kind of uh you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and it i i dont know if um it was for everyone you know i dont know laughter if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it uh thats thats a good question i do sigh uh i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom um i used to i i watch the office a lot so i kinda know when thats on so ill ill turn that on you know just uh kind of zone out a little bit to uh you know like familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or um maybe like uh eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but uh like in n out i really like going there so if i have to unwind um you know its once every few months maybe ill do that uh or i really like to read um especially like uh ill read the days events you know that that really relaxes me for some reason even if its reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still ill read the headlines and i really like to know whats going on that kind of centers me um so i i really enjoy that thats something i do to relax i would say sigh im pretty great at it although i dont i think my nature makes it pretty uh easy eas makes that pretty easy i dont laughter i dont get very upset up upset um easily at all so i its not much of a challenge to control my temper eh um yeah i dont do i dont really have anger issues i its its difficult for me to get angry uh so i dont i dont laughter i dont really have much trouble with that at all the last time i argued with somebody was probably sigh i dont even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i mightve had uh with family or friends about things but just a full on argument i i i i cant even remember its been years i i dont really argue too much i try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my my personal life i dont um really see anything to be gained by and i kind of uh naturally repel away from it so i dont sorry i dont do laughter i dont have much to say about arguing something i feel guilty about i would say that uh you know sometimes somet i eh sigh sometimes i dont really um i feel like i maybe havent made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot um i i feel like i theres always more opportunities uh out there that that were missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because theres always something that i could be doing that im not even if its just putting away the laundry that thats been um i took out of the dryer thats been sitting there or running late i really dont like running late um although sigh it happens more than id like to id and i dont know why i feel guilty about that i dont like keeping people wait waiting because it makes it feel like uh you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true um sigh hmm um nothing immediately comes to mind i well sigh the last car accident i got into i it was a few years ago i guess i i wish it hadnt have happened not that i wish i ive could erase it from my memory but i eh was um driving in rush hour traffic and you know i i thought the cars in front of me were were going um you know at least for a little you know ten fifteen feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a deep breath you know xxx slow rearend collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and deep breath uh i i wish that hadntve happened absolutely uh i know kn i know its a minor thing but it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially and the the people i got into an accident with were fine but i was wa you know they they you know didnt ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but uh it was just uh horrible timing um deep breath so i i wish that hadntve happened it does suck laughter it did suck im over it now but eh yeah it it does suck well im a pretty good sleeper i although i im naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job um allows me affords me a pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh i wish i could cou were like hardwired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up til one or two every night uh and its just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep its not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i i wish i were more um able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to going to sleep later and waking up later ive been pretty feeling pretty good i ive been i have no complaints physically and you know healthwise i feel good um you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh um everything is great so far i i have absolutely no no real complaints uh as far as how im feeling about myself or anything like that no no ive been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that um everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing um kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has has happened or is happening no no well i think theres plenty of things everybody regrets uh yeah yeah theres theres plenty of things um sigh in my life uh yeah like i said i i do regret uh you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i theres a period of time in my early twenties where i i didnt work for a while i just uh i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just uh you know we we got high every day um or it seemed like every day i dont know it was just uh eh but it was a it was kinda like a throwaway period in my life i would say that um sigh its important to to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think its also i would say that its important to um recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what wha what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from the people you surround yourself with i think that uh i would say also that um kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which eventually they do but i i think that you know theres a bit of lost time with that um that approach its kinda fatalistic and i i think that i would say you know um just try to concentrate you know you know not no not everyone works on the same schedule and life isnt a race but i would say that it was its important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and um thinking that things will fall into place um sigh well i sigh i i guess when people i i dont especially um take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for f at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i im sure im wrong about that so i think just maybe in terms of like uh group work that ive done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is uh kinda picked apart or or scrutinized i dont d i dont deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh somebody with much less experience exp it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody just out of uh college you know um went over what we had done and you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um i i didnt think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh sigh not no eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldnt have viewed it this way but i thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but you know it wasnt our call sigh mm most memorable experiences um well i guess the sigh first thing that comes to mind is one of my um the first real trip i took by myself uh i i took the uh the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things um for about ten days on my own uh so that was kind of the longest period of time up til that point and i was in my i was i dont know twenty three maybe at the time that i id really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time um and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh you know exposed to the things i wouldnt have seen if i had had traveling companions um and it was a lot of fun uh well ive been very happy recently i for the i im getting married in a few months uh i got engaged on labor day uh in two thousand twelve thanks laughter so i i was uh that was a very happy day this this whole process you know of um of meeting someone and we we kinda progressed very quickly realized where we recognized where we were um so i ive been a pretty happy state the past uh well its been eleven months now but um yeah so i i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been very happy times um new years was happy you know uh i im in a happy period of my life right now so yeah yeah thank you laughter uh sigh with a sigh sort of um sense of humor that maybe not everybody gets id say uh also uh you know um helpful calm relaxed maybe uh sigh intelligent um you know likes to recycle i know thats so something that they would say uh i what else i think that um my best friend might say that uh i i i like animals ive always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person or i mean a an animal person excuse me i also um you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans mm uh id say one of sigh most proud of in my life um hmm tisk well sigh i i im pretty happy with the level of education ive gotten im also going back eh starting in the fall im starting a phd program so im happy about that im happy about you know breaking some of my bad habits from the past i id say if im proud of anything its that um you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often im im very happy about that i dont know if pride is the right word but um my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh id say maybe the fact that its a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change im im happy and proud of that no problem have a good day thank you goodbye
synch yes im doing pretty good thank you i was born in the san fernando valley in california really laughter uh i love the beaches i like uh theres just many things to do and uh you cant beat the weather uh traffic cost of living uh no i havent uh ive only been out of the country once or a few times actually but only to one other country mm well they were when i was younger before i turned twenty one and we used to uh go to tijuana across the border just to get into nightclubs and stuff like that uh well i love to see new things new places uh and uh have new experiences uh after high school i went to beauty school for cosmetology mm well at the time i was uh looking for a career change and uh i have some friends in the industry and uh i decided to take the classes and see see what i thought uh only as a hobby mm well uh thats a thats a tough one to answer id have to think about that i would be on the outgoing side uh just because im more outgoing than i am shy laughter uh lotta times i smoke marijuana mm not the best uh i had an argument with my mother over uh how we should handle doing things with my grandmother well we just had differences on uh who should do what at what times and whos in control and uh i should pretty much let her uh follow her rules because its you know shes her daughter well its okay i understood we talked it out and you know realized that uh i mightve been uh overstepping my bounds uh its fairly good i am pretty close with my mom and uh my grandmother i have a stepfather and a halfbrother we get along okay but were not very close and ive never met my real father um maybe not accomplishing as much as i should have in my life up to now uh yeah maybe by not having enough uh ambition or drive to be in a better position in my life uh well one of the hardest decisions was when i moved moved uh away from los angeles to wisconsin well when i was younger i was getting in trouble and i was looking for a way out so i went and continued getting into trouble and i deep breath with a friend sigh uh we just packed our bags and moved to milwaukee yes uh extremely difficult i guess uh i got a lotta things going on or not going on and it just makes it hard for me to sleep um issues in my life and uh sure sometimes mm i guess it depends on what i have to do right now a little well in the last few minutes since we started talking about depressing stuff i starting to feel a little more down i havent no mm very seldom psh stop thinking about em mm i dont know i couldnt tell i couldnt answer that right now um i guess i felt uh eh its been awhile since ive been really happy i dont have uh a whole lot of very happy thoughts as recently mm deep breath oh lets see i sigh did go to las vegas uh a couple months ago i had a good time there well im a honest person for the most part reliable uh i think im easy to get along with wow where do i start i have plenty of uh bad decisions i could erase um yeah well i have a dui on my record uh well for the time it suspended my license makes it extremely difficult diff makes life extremely difficult well yeah its uh hard to get around when you cant drive legally and if you do drive illegally youre at risk of going to jail for driving without a license uh well the original charge did but i havent got caught driving since mm i dont have a best friend mm well lets come back to that one mm maybe that i could uh follow through with some of my plans be a little more ambitious maybe not uh well we some of the decisions ive made in my life i have regrets sigh uh take care of business first and always handle your responsibilities good go uh good weather good music good company good conversation mm sigh wow i dont have an answer for ya i love to uh bike ride i can go for walks or hikes uh i love to swim in the ocean mm my mom well she uh she was a single mom with two kids and uh worked really hard to raise us yeah yeah it wasnt easy very sure bye laughter
synch yes um pretty good kind of laughter yeah laughter about los angeles yes the thing i like about la the weather its not easy to meet people well it just feels like people arent out very much theyre like that movie in crash where people are just sit in their cars all the time um it feels like that no not too much child development well i have a son and i wanted to know how to be a a good mom and so i wanted to know about the stages uh that he would be going through eh and be able to relate better to him mhm i am kind of im trying to get it started again in the fall id like to write well um ive written some childrens books and ive just been doing research looking into getting my books published its only like two that ive written so far but theyre pretty good ive gotten some good feedback on them from my critique groups laughter its about a little boy thats surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries to not become a jerk with them and laughter it puts him in like a really scrubbedentry he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life mhm um no ive had some issues some nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so laughter um no im a single mom it was the hardest thing i think in the world laughter is being a single mom laughter so how do i cope deep breath um sigh well right now um i didnt have very many good goo coping skills or mechanisms so that was the problem its so spontaneous like the stuff that comes outta kids mouths sometimes and the stuff that they do and just brings a smile to your face um well when my son was younger once we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend laughter so yeah its pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kids telling me i need to not be single anymore laughter the hardest thing sigh not wanting to screw it up i feel a lot of stress and pressure that every little thing is gonna make ma make a difference and matter in what kind of person my kid turns out to be and so its a lot of stress on yourself laughter yeah yeah laughter definitely um hmm i think im different from my mom because im a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction i welcome it you know i welcome getting to know who my child is right now and not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just see them become the best child that they can be the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily into a different person laughter so say it again whos someone thats a positive influence um sigh mm i dont really have anybody like that okay well ive tried to meditate sometimes but i dont really stick with it often enough um ive tried to like go for walks but i dont always do that and i dont always stick with it laughter so yeah thats about it sigh id say im a little below average meaning that i get angry more than most people do i think hmm last night laughter but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband um we have my sister lives with us and she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment i should say and shes got four people living in in one room so um its kind of stressful its really crowded and my husband is stressed out about it and you know im just saying to him that i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here then there was gonna be a mess in the house and shes gonna be asking for things you dont really wanna do thats just how my sister is laughter so the house is messy and its crowded and every day theyre asking for rides and my husband hes avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesnt wanna be there anymore and im just saying that hes gonna have to find a way to deal with it because he asked for it in my opinion laughter so laughter hmm it does laughter oh ive got tons of em but right now whats on my mind is um losing custody of my son um right now like ive been arguing with my stepmom and my stepsister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated like they dont have any boundaries and i believe that boundaries are important establishing whos the adult whos the child they let my child boss em around and stuff anyways because of this theyre gonna be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that yeah theyre gonna be saying that im not a good mom because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different ideas about child raising shes my stepmom shes my dads fifth wife and shes she really doesnt shes really far removed from how i was raised and i wanna raise my child more similar to how i was raised where youre we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us and with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants and thats fine when youre a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes and when im in the same house with them they should be following my rules and not trying to go and break all of my rules sigh anyway laughter yeah um in that moment sigh just really frustrated because they dont listen to me i feel disrespected i feel like invisible i feel just angry that theyre taking away my right to parent and its something that i worked really hard to do i went to school and i studied child development ive read all the magazines and ive read the books and im really laughter i know what im talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities and to have these people that havent done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent try and tell me that im a bad parent its really uh hard to believe so i feel very disrespected um unacknowledged angry frustrated all those things laughter um i take i take benadryl to help me sleep and im so laughter my doctor gave me that laughter uh she gave me benadryl told me that i could take it to help me sleep and last night i was crying before i went to sleep so sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when youre in bed but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep more easily laughter yeah im always thinking about my son how i wish he was with me and how unfair everything is thats happening sniffle and like i dont deserve to have my son taken from me because im a really good mom you know sobbing and im too hard on myself so but i am a good mom and i feel confident that im a good mom i just i dont really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the sons dad does he has more money than me and right now im trying to be okay with it because i know he can do more for him financially than i could but that doesnt mean im not a good mom laughter hmm im pretty depressed im on antidepressants um i take wellbutrin i been on them for a couple weeks now i think theyre working i dont know im not as down as i was i mean i got here today i got dressed laughter i made it out and im here today so not that bad um sigh hmm my husband complains a lot he says im not the same person that i was when he married me he said i was fun and i was positive and i was all these other optimistic things thats another thing he was on the phone telling me last night and sniffle and im not those things anymore laughter which is true i mean we got married a year ago and then my son was taken shortly after and it was just such a shock and um ive just been trying to get back from it but its been hard did i think i had a problem before i found out found out what oh um yeah like crying a lot something like i cry all the time sobbing and laughing it doesnt take much for me to cry im just crying thinking about crying but like um my family would invite me to family events and i would go and just just cry because my son wasnt there sniffle or um i dont know its just all the crying i think and like i said my husband letting me know that im not the same person so hes disappointed and i feel bad even that crying and laughing im not the same person that he he knew crying and laughing i feel bad about that too another thing im feeling bad about you know crying yes i do i try do i feel like the therapys useful um yeah its nice to talk about your problems i go in there and i cry every week so at least i have a set time every week where i can go in and cry laughter um thats i mean its a release to be able to cry sometimes i feel better afterwards um yeah and she helps me make decisions you know help me to be more proactive in my life um well im looking for jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why dont you work here or why dont you work there or have you thought about this or that you know and then she said something about why dont you go back to school and so i went and applied to go back to school you know im not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isnt helping my depression any either so im trying to find a work and i applied for college in the fall i got accepted to dominguez hills so i may be going back to school in the fall right now im still looking for work but she helps me with that kinda stuff just giving me ideas that life isnt over laughter that theres still more you know i could be doing with life life yeah everythings always bittersweet um i dont know last time i was really happy i dont know laughter my ideal weekend oh i dont have a lot of money cause im not working right now so really my weekends are just spent reading maybe but i cant really i i cant pay much attention when im reading so laughter i have a short attention span i can only read a couple chapters deep breath um but lately i say thats what ive been doing is reading something ive read xxx okay i like to go to usc they have these nights where they have things like book signings or poetry and art its called visions and voices so i like to go out to t to their events and i usually enjoy those um about two weeks ago um deborah harkness was there doing a book signing for a discovery of witches and so like i said im trying to be a writer so i try to go especially to the book signings and see what its like to be an author whos talking to a crowd and signing books laughter my son laughter i dont have any friends my best qualities um sigh im smart im goodlooking um im really um and like a hard worker i im dedicated to like selfimprovement um thats all i can think of right now laughter okay okay goodbye press the buzzer now
synch yes uh doing okay doing okay uh north carolina yep uh almost four years ago um i graduated college had an internship out here uh for a production company so i started doing that with a group of friends and then got work after that and enjoyed the city so much and have been working out here since yep uh probably three th at the most three times a year maybe twice usually the holidays maybe one random trip in there mhm um uh its las only now just starting to become home to me in the sense of that respect where like uh going home was going home now going homes like going back to see my family and seeing some friends um but um i i feel more i feel more like i belong in los angeles than i do back at home uh the food um the weather goes without saying uh i the th i like the resources there i like feeling um i like that uh the things that i wanna do uh are much easier much more accessible out here than they would be in north carolina so it i feel like im uh uh im able to uh pursue eh a lot of my passions ambitions in a much more functional and realistic way living in los angeles than i am in north carolina uh i mean the cost of living isnt great but at the same time too i always kind of tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much um resources resour so many resources out here so uh its not even expensive as new york or boston so uh its not the worst but um uh and also i mean it is a little bit annoying that every time i do wanna go home its a flight not a drive i cant i mean conceivably con really conceivably drive home for the holidays cause its about a three or four day adventure and just not practical so its uh unfortunate that im so far away in that respect but i cant really change geography uh laughter laughter i studied uh history and uh media studies and production uh yes i work as a freelance writer and producer um in college i realized i was pretty good at it and uh i knew there was a way to monetize that and i came out here and uh worked a little bit uh in the uh public sector in trying to you know just doing those jobs that way and realized i could make more money have more control over my schedule and my life if i did it freelance so ive been doing it now for a little over a year now i do um i love traveling i try to uh go somewhere new for a good period of time about every uh seven to eight months just try to mix up things so i was in barcelona just recently and im planning on going to um either vietnam or even back to europe in next couple months so mhm uh i enjoy the break from routine i think that uh while its nice to wake up and kind of have a vague idea where your days going uh after a few months you can get very much kinda caught up in that and you uh pigeonhole i guess your thought process your expectations for the day and i love going to a foreign country and just waking up and knowing that everything i do that day is gonna be brand new and will be different than what i would be doing if i was in los angeles or and um our own routine so i im a big fan of that and i love the food so its great to just eat um a lot of food that i love in the places where they were originally created uh yeah sure i went to uh barcelona uh like i said a few uh months ago and that was mainly because i had a friend who was living there for uh six or seven months and she kept asking me to come out and uh i finally i was at a point p point in work where id been working so much for months on end that i felt like i deserved a break so i went there for two weeks and yeah it was one of the healthiest smartest things ive done in awhile so i mm reminded me again how uh how important it is for me at least to uh to travel and to get out of the world im very outgoing i uh love talking to people and conversing even virtual people oop i lost ya um to relax i uh listen and play music a lot i like to read uh i like to go see movies uh cook i cook a lot so i enjoy cooking um uh my m my girlfriend and i are uh currently separated by distance um so i havent seen her in weeks and that can be very uh sad obviously so ill talk with her as much as i can but uh but yeah just uh um uh pretty simple tastes yep participant is talking to rachel who has entered the room to fix a problem with ellie laughter this is awkward isnt um i dont really have much of a temper so uh very good i guess i dont really get angry easily or quickly and uh when i do im usually aware of it enough that i can kinda formulate how i feel and why im feeling that way and what i want to be done about it so uh so its pretty i guess im a pretty easygoing guy in that respect sigh uh honestly it was probably something petty over like uh misremembering when uh something was done or like a a date on something or like a a a fact probably wasnt anything emotionally fueled uh and it was just about yeah i think it was probably about like trying to figure out when exactly we went to san francisco and it wasnt even an argument as much as just the other person thinking the other persons misremembering so um in you know small or big situation its very difficult for me to actually feel enraged uh i guess in the classical sense of the word um sigh im trying to think im not one one for regrets um um i just recently did a uh uh a project like a a film and uh the subject matter had a little bit to do with like an exgirlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it uh i made a point i to i didnt wanna send it to her directly cause i didnt want her to think that i was doing to xxx her face but i did send it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see stuff and i um uh maybe that tha she mightve couldve misconstrued that as being passiveaggressive i dont know um but um but yeah i mean thats something i i thought about but i dont really regret it as much as like maybe i couldve just let uh everyone ever everyone else who i wouldnt wasnt necessarily sure about if i should do stumble upon it as opposed to me directing it to them so just my thoughts there sigh laughter hardest decision ive ever had to make deep breath ah um sigh uh it was actually probably uh probably that uh ah i dont even wasnt even a hard decision with like i said with that the the same exgirlfriend that i mentioned of it was probably hard because uh i knew i had to uh break up with her after some stuff happened and um it was difficult cause i cared about her a great deal but also same tune it wasnt hard to arrive at the conclusion that i had to uh to uh break up with her but at the same time too it was not uh uh the easiest thing to kinda go through that process its getting on a rollercoaster that youre very much aware of how mm terrible or frightening its gonna be but you know you have to get on the rollercoaster so uh so yeah id say thats probably of recent memory ugh just a abundance of laughter reasons that uh this person was probably not the uh best person for me so uh like i said it was a it was i didnt have to uh i didnt have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out um it was pretty clear sign and i have no regrets about doing it now um i uh yeah i feel very strongly then about it and i felt i still feel very strongly that i made the right choice now um sigh it can be it can be tough there be b theyll be i feel like its either if i if ive exhausted myself during the day between work and you know ive ive started exercising again which is a huge help but um but id say that its i kind of when i get into bed at night i never know how its gonna go sometimes its uh sometimes ill wake up within an hour of falling asleep and i cant go back to sleep or um ill just yeah periodically keep getting up and up um so its something thats gotten a little better in the last few weeks but uh yeah um like i said especially having my uh my current girlfriend uh not around like i said shes a very big source of comfort around so like that uh um but she travels a lot for work so its something to have to adjust to and uh uh sleep can be can some that suffers from that but uh in the same respect im not someone who actually i feel like i dont need too much sleep i if i can get if i can get four to six hours im in pretty good shape that day so um uh little anxious i guess uh little more mo more just um uh i just whenever i get off of a assignment uh theres always just the question like what am i whats going on next and uh so far i dont have the next um project lined up so its always that nervousness um in the past something usually does come up so you have the precedent of it usually working out but until it does youre always a little um uh anxious and it can be depressing cause its like uh um you know ive chosen a very much a lifestyle that while i get to have a lot of control and autonomy over my life uh it also is all on me in order to do it and you know sometimes im i um im very jealous of the idea of people just waking up going to an office for eight hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a group of people or or company um carrying them through when um its a little tough whereas like me if i have an off day or if im a sick day um that no work gets done laughter you know im a small business that has one employee how do i cope with them um i assume you mean i guess uh people i work with how do i cope with the uh maybe the better answer would be how do i cope with that lifestyle and just i got much m uh much more used to it something im still learning and figuring out how to how to handle uh as far as not just like i know the the how rewarding the work is when i do it but its also figuring out whats the most efficient way to live the life and you know how do i uh whats the appropriate way to budget finances whats the uh expectation i should have for myself in a given year whats realistic whats hopeful um and thats something that im sure will take years and years to do but i feel like as long as im getting better at it then uh its progress right uh yes uh definitely once and then probably i if i wouldve gone back uh um i was gone in high school probably it wouldve been second time but um but yeah ive been diagnosed with depression once so i feel like its one of those things that uh is something i have to keep in check throughout my entire life you know um i feel like im a pretty happy person for the most part but um uh has they i hate as annoying as it is but like they say like with people who are very creative or people who do a lot of stuff with the mind it tends to follow and i get that its a selfesteem thing cause its so hard to feel um so hard har or so easy i should shou suppose to get in your own head about that uh this was within a year so i probably was feeling uh symptoms having been there before it was kinda easy to figure out like ah you know its kinda happening again so i feeling uh the symptoms again uh uh and going through those emotions and feeling like okay at first i was kinda hoping it would be something i could kind of work through myself but um i realized it was just stupid for me to try to fight the battle on my own so i went and um started seeing a therapist uh uh really bad this is when i i just couldnt sleep at all like i would get maybe an hour of sleep a night at best um i wasnt sleeping at all had just no sigh uh no no drive to do anything whether it was you know as simple as brushing my teeth or cleaning my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that its like oh this is all in my head and its not even like a a symptom so um uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression uh no i just finished up uh finished up i mean since i didnt graduate or anything anyth like that but i got to a point where i felt like uh um i kind of talked through as much as i could talk through and id moved on eh in other places in my life it was in kind of a good good work xxx especially like i said i was i was working on something i really cared about um im now with someone i care about greatly and uh um theres such a potential opportunity for me to not even have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that uh i felt like therapy was not necessary and also i just didnt really have the time to with as much work goes on so oh i definitely i think having someone you can confide in uh who isnt your friend or your family member who wont you know have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or anything like that is definitely a a something beneficial i cant imagine how anyone couldnt benefit from having that on a somewhat of a routine basis um sigh i dont know im im a firm f kind of a firm believer that the all those things like those things that kinda can haunt you are also there for a reason like uh uh my sister died when i was uh about bout what twelve years old and she was younger than me and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh i felt like i grew up a lot that day so its um also difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child i dont want to forget those things cause i think theyre very integral to um how i cope with life and how i perceive uh um hardships and obstacles and uh having that image of knowing my father on its very very humanizing cause its so easy to kind of you idolize your parents and i still idolize my father but to know hes hes a guy like me and as i get older its um easier identify with uh the man he is psh so id be uh sixteen or six um uh i kind of like the notion uh that uh theyre they always say you wouldnt worry as much what people thought about you if you realized how people how much people didnt think about you and thats really hard to tell a sixteen year old and i dont know what the point of telling a six year old but um but yeah i feel like especially when youre in high school until it gets i mean nowadays you y i mean we live in los angeles where so much is caught up in how people think about you and i still am very if i find out someone eh either is upset with me or doesnt like me it bothers me to a great deal or i hate letting people down so i would like to come to a healthier place where just knowing that sometimes you just cant really control how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world so uh im a very compassionate guy i um im there for my friends im pretty selfless in that respect i um have a good humor about things like even with laughter even with being depressed or depression i can joke about it its not you know im not a morbid depressed more just the im aware of when im uh im low and uh i treat it as such and i dont you know i dont try to deny it i dont try to like any of that but i i i have a im a im a pretty like practical person in that respect i dont think uh even when im depressed i dont take it out on people or i dont think people people have told me they dont even seem to when i mention that cough been going through like depression no one seems to like or they dont mention i for one feel like when i do go through it its like oh everyone can just tell and im just a smoking gun of sadness basically laughter but uh but no i i tend to carry it pretty well and uh um i dont i dont lose sight of uh the reality rea the reality of what i know is happening so mm um i was on a my uh my girlfriend came uh she was in thailand for three weeks and then she was supposed to go to spain for two but she canceled that trip and came back and stayed with me for about ten days and um yeah i know i laughter i love her shes great um shes the coolest person i know and so much fun and she uh when shes around she makes me so happy and uh um so having her for ten days and we just had like normal we we rarely get normal couples time like its always like oh i see you for five days and then one of us has to go somewhere um so to have ten days just normal where we could just cook dinner at home like lie in bed and read books or anything like that was great and uh it makes me so happy that i have someone that i can do that with and just it feels so uh practical and feels so right um sigh i guess for xxx im im im a good guy like i i i know i dont uh i dont think i screw people over i dont um im a good friend to have im im there for people i look out for people i care uh about people and what they think of me and that goes especially much for my friends and i try to make sure you know with a lot of my friends being on the east coast i try to carve out time to make sure that they know i think about them and i call them and so i i feel like uh for a lot of people who count me as their friend im probably one of their better ones in just the sense that im i know how much i appreciate and respect uh the friendships we have thanks ellie bye
synch yes pretty good alexandria virginia mhm uh i moved to la uh end of two thousand one yeah its crazy laughter um a couple times a year usually like for holidays hmm sigh it is sigh its very different um i think its a lot more mellow um its way more like suburbia its nice um it theres something comforting about it but its always like i get a little restless when im there and look forward to coming back here where theres a little more action sniffle i went to um grad school at usc um it was it wasnt bad i mean my my program that i was in was so intense that like for the first year it was so all consuming that i really didnt have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like i laughter my life was not my own so that made it kind of um easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so it wasnt bad film hmm sigh i uh had an epiphany one day um i was out of undergrad i was kinda floundering a little bit i didnt really know what i wanted to do and um just one day i kinda was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about and um i realized that movies m movies are the thing that i love the most and am most passionate about so that is how i decided to go to film school um a little bit yes and no its i dont im so s im like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years ive been uh producing like freelance producer sniffle sigh that is so the question of the moment laughter um i think that uh i dont necessarily have like a a job title thats my dream job but i knowits sort of what um i want and cause basically like ive been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i dont wanna do that anymore so im looking for something thats stable um you know full time nice benefits and um i definitely wanna stay in the entertainment industry um and i like you know what i love about producing is that its just like theres constant challenges and you sort of never know what is gonna get thrown at you that i thats you know its always interesting and exciting um so im sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a like room to to grow and advance and all that sniffle yeah laughter i cant see your shoes um i i like to travel um i dont know that i havent really been doing it a lot lately but i have you know in the past done a fair amount um i love the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people um i think its just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see whats out there and just you know see beautiful remarkable places and just and things and just experience different ways of living and different languages and different cultures sniffle um lets see i went to costa rica a couple years ago um my like best friend from growing up she and i went for like ten days  and it was thats probably that might be like my favorite trip of all time laughter like it was really awesome but laughter costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful um and we just spent like we went to three different places and um just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing and then like the last place where we ended up was this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like amazing physical exertion like doing ziplines and all these hikes so that by the time we got to the beach it was like weve earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of it hit all of the you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity um but it also im also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like lie on a beach with a book so it sort of hit everything sniffle laughter what do i do to relax um sigh i i mean depending where i am like if its you know if im like at work or something and im stressed out i just will you know kinda take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way um if im home i might just like you know throw on a movie or like a tv show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like sort of escape relief sniffle um pretty good i dont i mean eh it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesnt happen very often sniffle um the last time i argued with someone was laughter my mom and it was about money laughter deep breath um i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was like judging me unfairly and that was upsetting yeah laughter um its good uh you know they live across the country from me so i dont get to see them that often but like i usually talk to my mom on the phone probably like once a week and my parents are really supportive sigh um they are you know like when i go back home to visit like i enjoy en i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time um so id say we have a pretty pretty good relationship deep breath something i feel guilty about um sigh makes sounds with mouth i guess because im like in this sort of job hunting phase i feel guilty sometimes that im not like doing enough you know like there are times where like there are days where maybe like i shouldve sent out a few more resumes or done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough sniffle deep breath um sigh usually its pretty easy the last the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good im not really sure i havent figured it out but um ive just had more uh like nights where it either takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason um ive also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself up sometimes laughter because im talking which is weird laughter um so yeah its just i i dont know not that i have been able to identify i mean i guess maybe im like more stressed than usual just cause like i my job situation is like in flux but i i dont know there was no like event sniffle cranky laughter i value good sleep laughter and im so im used to it so its just yeah its not a good feeling sniffle um not really no yes deep breath um sigh like sigh i think in like october or november although this is actually its the second time its happened in my life but the first time was like many many years ago sniffle um i felt like i was a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it sniffle um sigh just having a hard time functioning on the most basic level like just getting up and taking a shower and like going to the grocery store and you know answering emails was just like it took so much energy um so yeah i just i wasnt  really functioning normally  yeah yes yes um laughter sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so deep breath i think that therapy is good for me because it helps me focus on my sort of patterns um and also like ah just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess its deep breath it gives me a more heightened like kind of selfawareness um so that as opposed to just like um kind of just reacting to situations im like mm just like noticing more what is going on um and it just helps to um i dont know its just helpful laughter i dont really real i dont really know how to explain it laughter deep breath sigh hmm sigh um i dont know um i laughter its laughter probably not good that i cant think of laughter i cant think of anything sharp inhale um eh maybe over uh over christmas being at home with my family yeah um well it just was that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then and um like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of feeling not laughter great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me um so when i was there with them it just um it just felt very like safe and comfortable and that just sort of like you know warm familial embrace laughter laughter um sigh laughter i think she would describe me as funny and smart and um a good listener nonjudgmental um i dont know laughter is that enough laughter deep breath hmm sigh okay um so this happened the the last like job that i had i mean i was it wasnt technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like a year and a half close to two years and uh i had a it very small company the boss bo had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of clears throat he sort of out of nowhere uh mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um essentially like the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company theyre the theyre really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah and hes like so im gonna onna im gonna onna have to stop paying you your retainer and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how he i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know even though i wouldnt be getting the retainer anymore he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldnt you know it wouldnt be like a dramatic decrease in the amount of money that i was making cough excuse me but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you youre fantastic yada yada so to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um this guy who had worked with us a bunch kind of like if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff he was doing my job so yeah so it just like it was a really rea laughter it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i cant really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like in a way thats like that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but thats what i wish laughter deep breath um sigh lets see i um a very loyal person deep breath um i am smart im organized i deep breath um very like caring kind um im conscientious and i work hard sniffle laughter uh man i think to uh be more confident and less passive um to really like focus on what i want and the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves sniffle hmm sigh um probably just some of the relationships that i formed with people um just like really you know deep friendships youre welcome bye
synch yes good its been a nice day the south bay can i ask you that question too oh okay thats where im from basically but like the south bay of it not much ive been wanting to move anyways just to get a changeup everybody thinks la is like everything its the best but its too many people and too much traffic clears throat i cant see your shoes sniffle driving and seeing new stuff last year i went to sacramento from here and stayed out for like a month living in my vw bus with my wife it was kinda cool camping just wanted to have fun something different art no a little bit probably doing what youre doing laughter im really interested in coming up with new ideas and stuff too clears throat outgoing laughter i havent been doing much to do relax relaxing lately but i like the beach good i argued with my brother last night actually about him talking to me with with more respect as a person i was mad and i wanted to fight its good but sometimes theyre just theyre too caught up in what theyre doing to pay attention to other peoples feelings like with my brother hes just hes just tense because of his situation and he tried to brush br brush it off on me wasting money cause im married now yeah not doing it something like probably taking some candy from the store no no taking money from my mom when i was like real young cause she well i was like i was in junior high school and i think i took like twenty from her purse and bought candy for my friends and i felt guilty though like the same day probably yeah that was probably the beginning of my stupid activities all my life or in the past couple years my wife im married to her weve known each other for about two years i met her at an art walk she actually went to usc too the past couple days has been kinda hard but i usually go to sleep good i think im kinda snappy sn i think im snappy positive optimistic yeah ive been thinking more positive positively lately and i wanna put a lot of stuff into action so ive been trying to train my mind into knowing that stuff is gonna come to me speaking to the universe easy if you just try it and do it everybodys got a spirit no no no i just told you i feel positive i was happy yesterday yester i happy yesterday cause i you know i made a couple good decisions wanting to be positive and stay away from negative people being alive knowing god i dont know i dont know i cant think of something now laughter mm i dont think i can have one sex exercising waking up positive and having a good meal in the morning i think driving to sacramento that time no dont smoke cigarettes and watch how you spend your money are you gonna sell my ideas and my my uh laughter thoughts i cant think of it right now
synch yes im doing okay its still morning so im from the east coast massachusetts yes um i moved to la when i was a child with my parents pretty much didnt have any choice in the matter laughter um i havent been back there the last time i was back there was uh three years ago for christmas um las very hustle and bustle theres a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people dont care about the other person here in la in which back east the east coast the the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors youre friendly to your neighbors and to anybody that you see in the street so the yeah um well since i was a kid i was fairly young at first it was rough i was getting in trouble a little bit in school but uh after all that surpassed i was wa i did fine in high shcool and stuff and even took some college courses um well i love the beach and i love the mountains i like to go hiking um and i like walking along the beach i just live a few blocks away from the beach so its easy no not at all um just not interested uh ive been to mexico a couple times when i was younger went to ensenada but other than that im im not interested in leaving the united states especially with whats been going on lately um overseas um laughter actually child psychology and i was in the nursing program for a little bit but i had some problems at home which caused me to drop out sniffle oh thats alright gah um i dont have one to be honest um i admire people that are doing the job that they love i mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money how great is that laughter so um im pretty outgoing when i meet somebody at first i might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment um as to if we wanna continue communicating with the person or not and but once ive decided that i like that person or whatever i i talk a lot so yes um i like watching movies i like i used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasnt been so great so its hard to get into a good book um not good at times i uh i have a some outburst every once in awhile so s eh it depends on how angry i get uh yesterday and it was with my partner and um actually to be honest i dont remember what it was about its just sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and i dont appreciate that and if i feel that im being disrespected or whichever im gonna stand up for myself so um at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and i say what im whats on my mind um i do not purposely go and hurt peoples feelings or anything of that nature but i wont be bullied and i wont be made i wont back down if i feel like im being challenged so um uh last year my mother died so i wish i handled that differently um it upsets ups its upsets me so its okay um let me see deep breath uh sigh i think im gonna pass on that one too because thatll upset me more so laughter sniffle that is terrible um sometime uh sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when youre done working and doing everything that you had to do in a day youre tired but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because its like i cant uh i get up and then im im wide awake ill go out in the living room turn on the tv and watch tv im lucky if i get three to four hours sleep um maybe because i do have a lot on my mind uh you know thinking about bills and and the stressfulness of work and and then all this other stuff so thats probably a big burst part of it uh its its not difficult its just frustrating cause when your mind goes on overtime mode it eh just affects everything your concentration your sleep your eating everything so im a little grouchy especially in the morning im not a morning person laughter i like the nights but i dont like the morning its like leave me alone until i get my first cup of coffee yeah so other than that im im okay um well ive been ive been depressed for quite some time and im still having difficulty diff difficulty uh cause after my mother died four months later my uncle died so i had two deaths last year so im still reeling and trying to get myself back together im i just recently ive started pursuing like interests that i used to do that i havent done in a year because of what happened um i just i might get angry a little easier i sleep a lot i eat i overeat um i get tired very easily cause im not getting much sleep so sometimes its hard it seems like im struggling to get through the day yes i have a uh psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis oh i was diagnosed quite some time ago um probably ten to fifteen years ago and its just something ive never gotten over i dont know whether or not you can so ive always taken the medicine um i was arguing with everybody my family my friends and stuff like that and i was feeling desperate and hopeless and i had attempted to uh take my own life years ago which caused me to be hospitalized and then uh they started treating me i started seeing a therapist so um well right now im not going to a therapist because my insurance theyll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist but i am working with a friend of mine who has ha knows some avenues to go to seek se seek help for a therapist and i dont know if thats really gonna help me i mean sometime someti it depends on what kinda therapist you get sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on and youre thinking my god what good is this and the other type is the type that will give you some kinda feedback as to how to deal with the emotions tools to help you deal with your emotions so um like i said i havent been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist just medication um theres been no changes really i i probably would be doing fine because i was doing great before my mom passed away i was her caregiver and uh even though a lot of times i feeled i felt overwhelmed or lacked l uh lacked patience with her uh i still was a heck of a lot happier than i am now so um uh sigh i would say when my son was born years ago im not a parent anymore he passed away so um and that was difficult as well uh hmm um im extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me because i get everything done that im supposed to get done even though sometimes i feel a little scatterbrained and um you know those qualities are are admirable in people that can keep their word and and be responsible excuse me oh i have lots of regrets um uh things that ive done in the past that im not too happy about but um you know i met somebody once in my life that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker uh live to never regret so you know you cant go back and make changes its too late so why you know dwell on the situation but sometimes so sometimes its a lot easier said than done um im not the advice kinda get person laughter i i you know i dont really give my friends any kind of advice i mean i find most of the times people dont listen to you anyway so why bother um i just state my opinion thats all um well right now im on a diet because of my overeating after my mom died i was a lot thinner when she was alive i just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot you know sleep eat sleep eat and so now im kinda like on a diet trying to lose this weight cause its very unhealthy for me um hmm trying to think its been a long time actually theres really nothing because now i just keep my mind busy i havent been to a movie in

synch yeah go ahead um im okay i grew up in wisconsin and i lived in colorado for a bit and then i lived overseas for a little while then i moved to california mhm i moved here at the end of june of last year so i guess its been what eight months something like that um sigh at the most probably twice a year laughter well my hometown is uh all of five thousand people  and um there are a lot of cows and barns and farms so the opposite of la laughter um sigh its a good question i ive always wanted to live in california so but i had been living in in the central coast um and i just had been coming down to la like once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff so um yeah things were were changing in santa cruz for me the client i had who was really the main like financial um main financial source i had that relationship ended so i was totally free to move and i thought well i guess ill give la a try and see what happens so so i gave it a shot and here i am oh not at all laughter its a very very big city um i lived in dublin in ireland it was a which is also a big city but you know european cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy um and yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and uh yeah so sigh laughter i love to travel i love it yeah ive i i lived in ireland and i traveled um i was in morocco and i was in costa rica um ive spent some time in mexico so yeah um i love sigh meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also not just seeing whats different but seeing whats similar among people everywhere you go um sure well i guess hmm im trying to think which was my favorite i mean eh there was amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but morocco was incredible it was like twelve days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains which are beautiful and uh yeah its a really really cool culture so it was fun um sigh my trip to ireland i actually visited there which is why i decided to move there so my most memorable moment of that trip i mean theres probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was um being on a bus and and leaving um dublin and going just out to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is i mean its everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in films and its green and lush and gorgeous but when you actually get there and experience it its it like the pictures dont do it justice so it was incredible yeah um i have an undergrad degree in english and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a masters degree in women studies no i use my english and psychology um i work in marketing communications so i actually do sales so um yeah the psychology definitely comes into comes into play and eh so does my i guess my undergrad degree in english but really like i took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an english degree just teach and i i wasnt wanting to teach um to guess im not clear on the question um okay laughter wow um sigh you know my dream job is being a a motivational speaker and trainer and coach um and traveling the world doing that and and impacting peoples lives and um really contributing to people um my relationships pretty good actually i i just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would not she was sporadic i saw her sporadically growing up i lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and um they had two kids together so i grew up and i consider them like the family i grew up with so but i got  in communication with my biological mother um last may and weve been weve you know cleared things up and have been in communication since then so um mutters well not sure which moment you mean but if youre referring to being in communication with my birth mother um i mean it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and eh not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah im shy laughter laughter um to relax i do a number of things i like to do yoga although i dont have the money for it right now um i love to dance i love to read i love to go to the ocean spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions that really recharges my battery actually probably more than anything else um i like to be with friends um i love art and trying new restaurants um yeah all those things are both relaxing eh i guess theyre relaxing in the sense that um i feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life so yeah yeah um depends if im driving not very good but otherwise im pretty good at it laughter um sigh last time i argued with somebody probably would have to be oh no it was with the la times about the newspaper delivery yeah that was the last time so yeah the sigh um the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of uh it didnt show up and uh i didnt realize that it wasnt there until um late i dont know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and they said they couldnt send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so i was angry with the la times i was angry with the people whod forwarded the newspaper and didnt tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated oh wow there are quite a few of those sigh um let me think about one um the other day i had a phone call and im in a coaching program and it was from sigh one of the coaches in the program and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls cause we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with um someone whos not my coach and uh that hadnt been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these people i have to be accountable to and im like eh you know i have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i dont know so yeah i wasnt um i wasnt angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but um yeah i couldve certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and wouldve made the call go a lot smoother hmm the hardest decision wow theres been a few i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision no it wasnt even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i moved uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado and um that was a pretty tough decision cause at that point my family had been you know within an hours drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging oh lots of things um i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um at the time i was very much into rock climbing and theres just a huge outdoor outdoo outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were um in my age group and or single that was another factor um and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit so yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move yeah uh that was totally unrelated question um sigh relatively easily it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if im out and i dont get home until eleven thirty then you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today but generally i can sleep through the night ive had some pretty anxietyridden dreams the last couple of weeks um but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily um yeah im sure they are i mean im in another transition state im moving out of out of the sigh house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman sigh um yeah and i just i have to find the financial means to support me in doing that and its and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being shes exhausting and utterly depressing so yeah um living with her is pretty hard like its probably the hardest thing ive ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i dont think i wouldve said yes to the situation um i feel trapped and helpless like theres you know nothing i can theres no way out of the situation that im in no matter what i do it doesnt get any better i dont d i dont i know im not getting any kind of work that i want to do and mm my moneys not working at all so yeah it feels pretty crappy laughter thanks i have in the past yeah oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago i was suicidal oh yeah i feel down mhm i dont actually no um well i originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed and um and then i began therapy again later on think i was wa it was in my early thirties um and then i we ended that because id moved to ireland so yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i dont go into therapy thinking oh im gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think thats ridiculous i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you cant see and you know work through that situation and come up with um a strategy for not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and uh tools for the rest of your life so that you dont have to be in therapy forever deep breath sigh the last time i felt really happy sigh wow huh wow thats pretty sad um it was at least a year ago no i thats not true it was when i um saw my biological mother which was last may my best qualities um sigh im very strong very strongwilled i um am very supportive and loving and nurturing um im easy to be around im intelligent and um yeah anything i regret i dont think so no sigh dont take life too seriously laughter oh my ideal weekend um i spend some time at the beach ill spend some time with friends um either going out at night you know to a movie or just going out to um a club or a bar or somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together um maybe go dancing after um and sundays i usually go to scrubbedentry and then i have brunch with friends and um yeah i go home and sunday night i get ready for the next day so hmm sigh i am most proud of um a few things i mean ive moved to places that i wanted to move to and uh so ive done things that have really spoken to me and have meant something you know been dear to my heart to actually um mm achieve those those um goals or those yeah ive done things that ive wanted to do like move to ireland and move to california mhm okay sure bye
synch yes pretty good i grew up in boston about thirty years ago yep not too often maybe once a year sometimes less oh i love living in la i dont ever wanna live anywhere else well i came out here to go to college and i wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and thats part of it uh very easy well maybe somewhat easy the beginning the first few weeks was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody i knew but after a few weeks it was great broadcast journalism well its something id wanted to do since i was twelve and everything i did from the time i was twelve until i went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream no laughter well its kind of a long story but i got laid off from my first job when i was in my twenties and it just once i had done that work i realized thats not really what i wanted to do it was too cutthroat of a business and it just really wasnt suited for me it didnt make me happy yep sigh my dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries deep breath well the work itself is not very hard im very good at what i do the hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them it i used to i dont travel so much right now i love seeing different places and different things like i love going to places that are not like where im from my favorite trip is i went to australia for my thirtieth birthday cause i wanted to lose my thirtieth birthday as i crossed the international date line and i went to this really small sigh place up on the uh west coast of australia called sharks bay where native dolphins live and swim and is very isolated for the most part and i got to be there for a whole week and just really just pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you and its amazing just a beautiful beautiful spot in the world more shy sigh deep breath why sigh hmm thats a good question um partly the first thing i think of is cause ive always been that way but maybe thats an excuse i dont know um deep breath i just prefer to be quiet and id rather be with fewer people than lots of people so sigh deep breath i watch tv sigh a lot or thats probably not the best alternative but it is something i do and i also walk on the beach cause i live close to the beach so thats one of my favorite things to relax deep breath pretty good it depends on the situation but most of the time im pretty good deep breath um i dont think i tend to argue with people i think i just get mad about situations but not at people directly sigh sigh hmm sigh i dont know if i feel guilty about anything at the moment not sure i have one at the moment deep breath noise other peoples noise makes me really mad um i live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors that that just makes me really mad sigh yeah sigh hmm sigh well the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is is when i bought my condo it felt like a really hard decision at the time you know i didnt know that i could do it i didnt wasnt sure if i had the money to do it um so that felt like a really difficult decision but in hindsight course it turned out to be a great decision but at the time it was really difficult to do that pretty easy i sleep pretty well sigh deep breath for the most part good im im just really worried about money sigh at the moment so thats my biggest so i cant say that im like great but i its cause i am worried but you know im also confident that things are gonna work out nope sigh nope sigh hmm sigh i dont know i cant remember i mean i dont feel super happy all the time but i dont feel unhappy either sort of like just uh even keel well i got to go to the um my friends work at the motion picture academy so i get to see all the xxx oscarnominated movies scrubbedentry she was there one night so uh i really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again so that was very pleasant sigh deep breath i think they would say um reliable and loyal sigh and considerate and thoughtful deep breath no sigh i really have worked hard on that i think there are lots of things maybe i would do differently but theres nothing that really i regret um deep breath well i just think that there are things that um sigh like its not worth wasting the energy to think about things that i regret so i dont have a lot of xxx regrets about things deep breath oh thats a good question sigh um sigh dont worry about the small stuff and save more money laughter like deep breath well theres uh you know the normal things like id lose more weight and i would um uh sigh think be a little more fearless maybe sigh be a little more bold i dont think i have any the of those deep breath well im i am selfemployed so i work all the time laughter so my ideal weekend is having lots of clients um thats something i enjoy um so that would that would be ideal at this point my weekends if i were really busy deep breath that ive really been able to take care of myself and that you know ive done pretty much everything that ive said that ive wanted to do ive done that and i dont and i dont have regrets about things theres nothing really that eh is un feels undone in my life sure theres plenty of things i still wanna do um but i feel like ive done what i said i was gonna do deep breath yeah sigh thats not so great well its okay um both my parents are deceased and i have a sister and a brother um i feel closer to my brother than my sister but um they both live on the east coast and i live in la um and then i have ha my sister has two girls so i feel very close to my nieces although we dont talk as much as we used to cause theyre teenagers so they have other things on their mind deep breath um probably my teacher a person i learned my holistic body work from i really like to sigh model my work and my way of being after him like hes a a good role model for me the way he holds his work and the way he lives his life deep breath um were pretty close were not you know best of friends but i do i know that i can call him any time i need him um sigh put me in a good mood sigh usually being with my friends or going out to dinner or um sigh yeah just spending time with my friends okay thanks sigh bye
synch sniffle sniffle yes im feeling okay little bit tired but for the most part feeling pretty good im actually originally from woodland hills which is out in the san fernando valley i was born there and then i moved to lomita which is in los angeles county about mm probably around nineteen ninety three so i mean im twenty three now so its about what yeah nineteen years or so ive been living there yeah clears throat some things that that i really like i would have to say you know the beach um you know not so much the traffic dont really care for that but um definitely you know just kinda like the nightlife um you know just people in general i like conversing with others so yeah clears throat right yep yeah actually i do i mean i cant see your shoes but um yeah actually i do travel a lot ive been to places like hawaii been to the caribbean ive been to uh lets see makes sound with mouth um you know just different places like arizona ive been to oregon washington pretty much all over i would say so but usually mainly like um hawaii and the caribbean mexico as well so yep clears throat um i think its just the experience you know like you cant you can kinda experience the culture um different people you know just just the whole background the scenery its just you know its its something new to experience i would say something that you know people havent seen before so clears throat well lets see i recently took a trip to hawaii a couple months ago that was back in december it was around christmas time new years so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different islands we went to uh lets see i think it was kauai went to oahu uh maui you know places like that so clears throat yep um you know i would have to say that um you know probably like in hawaii or like the caribbean you know just like i said before the whole experience factor just seeing um you know new different things things that are unique so clears throat yeah i actually study journalism right now im in my final semester so im about bout to graduate couple months clears throat yep well you know its kinda funny cause you know i started off at a uh you know a two year community college and so you know i was going into uh like business management something to do with you know i think thin basically um accounting but you know i kinda figured that wasnt for me so i decided to go into journalism cause i i couldnt i mean you know id probably still be sitting at a desk but you know at least with journalism i can go out in the field and you know talk to people and you know kinda you know receive information gather information that sorta deal and then you know write up stories i just thought it was you know it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kinda crunching numbers all day so yep laughter my dream job i would have to say um you know some something in maybe radio broadcasting sports broadcasting um you know i think that would be really interesting something thats definitely a passion of mine so clears throat my relationship with my family its its pretty good you know i i live with my parents still like i said im twenty three years old um you know theres certain times when it can be a little bit shaky little bit rocky but for the most part its its pretty good you know ive ive matured a lot in the last few years so things are uh you know getting back up to speed i would say things are things are going pretty well clears throat you know i think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle you know sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative to people when im relaxed and laidback other times i kinda its not so much like i go into my shell but you know at times like i can be kinda shy if i dont know people as well or if i havent ive never met them before so its one of those things that kinda ki yeah you kinda gotta meet me in the middle with it because you know i can either be talk very talkative or at times you know i i can be a little bit shy but you know once i once i get the conversation going im im fairly talkative and so clears throat laughter um you know usually um i would listen to music or you know maybe just you know kinda go for a drive or uh you know hang out with my friends you know just something to just to kinda you know ease ease that you know cause you know like i said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just wanna relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy so clears throat you know ive actually been better with that um couple years back you know i there was points where like i pretty much couldnt control my temper like whatsoever like li i mean i would just pretty much get angry at you know the littlest things everything would just kinda tick me off but you know ive ive definitely learned to uh you know control that sorta thing and you know its made me a better person because of it clears throat well lets see im trying to think its it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe its i i cant remember off the top of my head but you know its its always something so miniscule that thats why i probably dont remember it but you know eventually we make up and i apologize for it because you know i accept that you know im wrong in certain cer you know certain circumstances clears throat yeah something that i feel guilty about um probably you know not being as nice to others as i couldve been in the past you know i mean and that is the past and you know i dont like to dwell on that sorta thing but i think thats one thing that i that ive tried to work on but its also one thing that i kinda regret not doing just being just being nice clears throat hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty recent kinda tough because uh i actually have a buddy he was in the air force and he recently got diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough and its hard for me to talk to him because you know hes hes not really all there anymore like he used to be so its one of those things where i feel like im kind of ignoring him and i dont wanna do that but at the same time i dont know his tendencies he could be a little you know crazy so probably like you know some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so i dont know but yeah clears throat yeah its pretty tough you know cause we go way back been best friends with him sigh since i was probably about five six years old so its just yeah its just really hard to deal with but you know i i try to i dont i dont  you know try to keep in the back of my mind but you know its its always there i dont i dont ever forget so yeah clears throat my best friend laughter well hed probably say that you know im im a pretty pretty down to earth guy usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know i try to work on that too um hed probably say that im pretty funny um i like to hang out you know just kinda do things here and there you know just normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watch movies you know grab a few beers that sorta deal so yeah clears throat you know it varies sometimes its easier than others you know if im really tired you know ill probably have a very good sleep i havent been sleeping all that great the last few days cause you know my house uh theres workers on the roof so theyre youre putting in the new roofing so thats kinda tough so that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part i usually get a pretty good sleep clears throat lately eh been feeling pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up i actually got an internship about bout a month ago for um you know my field of journalism so thats good about to graduate in two months so im looking forward to that um starting to make a little bit more money thats you know thats good and uh yeah things are just going pretty well right now i cant complain clears throat yeah its its not bad you know like i said it could always be worse right but you know im im enjoying life so its the thats the best part clears throat i have not no nope no last time i felt really happy sigh man laughter you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still still had his sanity i guess you could say um we you know he came back to visit from the air force he had some leave so you know we were just hanging out um you know just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that that was nice but i miss that you know so clears throat i felt great you know it because theres nothing like having a best friend you can have conversation you know twenty four seven about anything can tell anything to him in confidence and he could tell me anything in confidence like thats hard to find you know especially someone that youve known for so many years and then you cant really get it back now so yeah clears throat yeah there theres a theres probably one or two things that i regret um well i mean i regret reg i got a dui about three or four years ago actually it was four years ago so thats something that i definitely regret because you know i look back on it and you know things mightve been different but at the same time you have to accept you know the actions you know circumstances that took place so you know i manned up and you know i guess i think im better off for it but at the same time you know its its always gonna be in the back of my mind like i said its just one of those things that you have to deal with in your own way clears throat laughter well you know its one of those things like laughter i was a child then so i i really dont know what to say i mean even if i wouldve listened then who knows but you know i probably wouldve told myself you know just be careful you know make sure you can be the best person that you possibly can can be um basically you know just always be nice be honest um just be caring toward others so clears throat um probably going back to uh my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing i dont say that i wish i could erase it i just wish that it didnt happen like that so clears throat yeah my ideal weekend uh i usually keep it pretty pretty generic i tend to hang out with my friends um either you know we hang out in the day you know do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers um you know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies you know just the standard stuff that people do so clears throat some things that i wish i could change um probably just you know be nicer like i said before um maybe not being as lazy have more determination i mean i i have quite a bit of determination i know what i wanna do with my life but i know there are times when i i kinda get a little lackadaisical so i wish i could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much so clears throat um well you know its its tough to think back but i would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is you know i would say probably like when i was you know kinda getting angry at certain people maybe just kinda chewing out my friends when i probably shouldnt have i was trying to give more constructive criticism but at the same time i knew it it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and they were out of character so clears throat my best qualities i would say that im definitely hardworking im determined im very caring now more than i used to be very honest and you know i i just i love to talk to people like i like making new relationships i like making people laugh clears throat clears throat something that i did recently that i really enjoyed um you know it was probably sigh over at my internship i was just you know i i wrote a story or two and it just felt good you know to get those stories done and eventually theyre gonna go into the paper so i feel accomplished about that you know its one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there you know its right in your face and you can tell yourself you know like i did that so makes me feel good yep clears throat um you know just lets see eh few different stories eh just usually things about well the the papers in long beach so its usually about you know stories or events that are taking place in long beach so yeah clears throat i would say that im most proud of you know graduating high school about to graduate college hopefully you know obviously im gonna earn a degree and then hopefully get a you know a good solid job you know in the near future i think thats one thing that im most proud of clears throat thank you
synch sure im fine im doing alright um yeah im from maryland yeah from maryland washington dc area uh like five weeks ago laughter laughter maryland um deep breath its a lot its a lot less um uh xxx its a uh its not as nice this time of year its more um uh its its good its nice its um las a lot better though its a lot its a lot more people lot more going on um im still st i guess im still getting used to it so um its its not like um yeah im still getiing used to it its its coming slowly but but surely i live in culver city i do i have one uh its okay its i live in a really nasty house its uh its cheap chea its cheap cause im living in a friends place um and uh but but and hes letting me stay there for half price but the the actual like place itself is pretty horrible horr horrible living conditions laughter but im moving soon so i cant see your shoes actually uh but no i i travel xxx i would say i xxx ive probably traveled more than most people in the us like considering that most people dont travel in the us but i wouldnt i wouldnt call myself a world traveler or anything i enjoy the chance to get to like see other um walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the the specificity of my own you know the the the the th given the parameters that i grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally um i mean even just within the us like seeing how someone in california grows up is so different from how someone in maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like thailand or something growing up its pretty its pretty amazing mhm uh okay um hmm putting me on the spot here ellie um lets see uh well um i its been awhile since ive been on a trip i guess one of the last trips i did was to um i mean it a xxx like two years ago i went on road trip across the us and that was that was pretty amazing saw but i guess the best place pl the best two places on the road roa i drove from maryland to la this is before i actually moved out here but um i i visited new orleans and new orleans was just this whole like even though its part of the us its like a totally its totally different than anywhere else its so um unique the culture there is so unique and and the blend of like caribbean and french and all these other influences into like the american south is so so um uh incredible incred eh yeah its just its its unreal un yeah its unreal hmm its a tough question um one on um makes clicking sound with mouth i uh hmm you know i i i you can you come back to that question are you capable of that yeah come back to it yeah thats what i just said film you know thats actually a question ive been asking myself i knew kne i know i my entire life ive had like phases of interest so when i was like very very very young i was really into like the first phase that i remember was keys and then tools like i would go around collecting keys and then id go around collecting tool like just every sort of tool i had a toolbox my parents have told me that i had a phase before that with which was balls like various balls um and then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and and stuff stu and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and at a certain cert and eh at a certain point i got really into um like rap ra like music like first fi at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then at some point in there i i had told to i rememeber telling someone that right now im interested in playwriting and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in uh film like i i could kinda see the trajectory coming but i dont remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always i was wa led a sheltered life uh as far as movies are concerned i didnt my parents didnt let me see an rrated movie until i was like in high school almost like um and uh and i never uh so i never saw an rrated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was fairly young maybe like six i saw star wars the first scene in darth dar star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guys neck and so just a little scene very at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room so im not really sure uh yeah its its its um i dont im not exactly sure how i got into film but uh ive always been fascinated by like how people interact and what like you know acting and stuff so and movies in general i am yes um to be a filmmaker to be able to direct and uh put pu put together and make ma like i guess direct i dont mm use that word so much cause it i think i think of it more as like i i want the opportunity to put together and make movies uh or to make movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it cause i want you know i want involvement in all the all the processes but i guess the best parabole for that would be a director directing well its a lot better when im not living with them um my i guess um its funny you should ask ellie um ive been thinking about it a lot lately i i think im close in my entire family im closest with my dad um i get along with my brother and sister you know like but i dont when away like my brothers in a foreign country right now so i dont have the opportunity to talk with him but like i spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else cause i feel like hes the most like of all my family hes the one who most accepts me and like um thinks positively about me um so its i have like a a complicated relationship with my parents i mean mea and my family in general well on the myers uh briggs personality test im uh im an extrovert but lately late like since moving but im not like um im not i probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion uh or on the scale of extroversion sorry um i would consider myself extremely introverted um i just i see other extroverts and just no matter who theyre around theyre able to like strike up conversations and im im a fairly shy person im sort of like uh or inhibited person maybe um so i like to like until yeah im but im working on it im working on it um well in the past i would smoke weed but ive quit smoking weed so now i you know i have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie um i dont have or maybe go like depending if its like an xxx if its um if its a worn out sort of stress like im just like then i thats what i do but if its a more like anxious type stress i might go on a uh an intense walk dont really exercise that much but i like you know competitive sports and hiking pretty good well i always like arguing um i wouldnt call arguing necessarily losing my temper um i i enjoy uh a vicious debate um but i dont as long as my like cause i wont like revert to personal you know attacks uh in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject um and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating cause im not like the best articulator of what i think um one of my weaker points i would say but um but the last time i had a a heated debate i think that was was that the question um what happened i forget i forget the question that that i had a heated debate hmm the last time i had a heated debate was um i had a heated debate about uh the movie boogie nights um i was wa i i didnt lose my temper exactly but i get like very extremely passionate about about cause i i dont think its like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the like best um best movies laughter why did they think it was the best movie um they think that like theres some theres some sort of theyll as i understand it they have um they have a certain uh they think that the like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that theres a whole like complexity of character within the movie and um that somehow like sigh um what what were they saying they were saying like the movie it like xxx its like the end of an era which makes it like kinda like casino and theres this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they how they interact in the plot um kind of like uh yeah i guess i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i its not like a bad movie or anything but its the um i just dont think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful mean meaningful of a character like i i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it um theres nothing bad about the movie theres nothing articulable art like articulable about thats its like solid so good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool um the eh it really rea you know its cool its but but its meaningless mea for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like so in the movie django unchained um you have django and django is like a kinda hes a two dimensional character but i dont think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is and um and you have doctor king schultz whos this uh whos this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent theres no way he wouldve risked his life to save django or like wouldve gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save djangos wife etcetera and um and the reason rea the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldnt but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not sacrifice themself for someone else um which strikes stri which strikes me as so like um like who uh like she she her basic ba her basic argument was that altruism al like altruism doesnt exist exi it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesnt exist um the only the only thing you can do is serve ser like the only thing people do is serve themself um so its not quite ayn rand but its like the only people peo thing that people peo like all people are out to serve themself which im not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision theres maybe like kernels of self selfinterest in there but she made it sound like selfinterest was the only motivating factor in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if thats like what your ultimate um purpose pur like if you if you cant like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate um and uh somewhat like yeah and its it uh so um so yeah that that i guess thats the the i dont think i necessarily like lost my temper um i think of losing my temper as being more um like i just so s i i would so s revert to um ad hominem like attacks uh but i i didnt like thats not um maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing crit like criticizing her world view but it i wasnt like well youre an idiot you know like it wasnt it didnt it didnt turn into abuse of any sort yeah im glad you understand deep breath an event or a i dont know if i necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like i remember feelings and moments not stories um like my life doesnt sync s always sync together into like a coherent story its like this moment and that moment and this moment and that moment so yeah the hardest decision ive ever had to make oh geez could it just be one of the hardest decisions hmm um like choosing between two things that its like i guess i im having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between two options like no theres no like sophies choice type moment in my life but i but i do think that the decision cause i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was a was very very difficult um and uh but i had to do it for money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends were either like leaving lea were most of them were leaving and going other places in the world and then uh the one other person who i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i didnt i was either gonna live with people who i wasnt as close with or craigslist or or move home and i i think it was a tough decision to to leave i i had ha in fact it was so tough that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back to new york within like a month or two uh which wasnt which didnt end up happening but that was the only way that i could leave new york it was how hard was that or how hard is how hard was that um it was hard laughter um it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like isolating isolating is cause also like id fallen fa like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends and uh that had kind of gone extremely badly and so i wasnt on speaking terms with her and i couldnt like that whole everyone on my list of friends who was like more mo closer to xxx her it was wasnt quite like her or me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of saw it at the time so i didnt like you know just being socially isolated etcetera yeah well recently its been awful um i uh i like two so the last last night i slept for like ten and a half hours um which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams but previous to that night so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep um because i was working on set and i would get back and either and i just like couldnt fall asleep for whatever reason its um too much riled up energy or something i i dont know tired uh very not immediately i guess initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning and um i also stopped drinking caffeine like i ive had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i hadnt had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so um i guess with with caffeine in my system im ready to im ready to go um without caffeine its im just im just quieter i guess more introverted since like lately as in when um change in my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a period of time like eh at the beginning where the the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx cause i moved here cause i have a group of friends here or couple of friends but i dont have like a a large number of friends and the the push to to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure was pretty um overwhelming at first and i think that im slowly like coming to terms with that um and moving you know moving past it i i but not necessarily nece you know like its still its still there the pressures there but im just you know you you know sigh you know sigh no i just nope the last time i felt really happy might have to reach back um i think the last time i felt really happy was uh during the writing process of so last year i shot a movie um cowrote codirected coproduced um and that was kinda like that it still consumes my life but um but i i i think during the writing stages of that movie in which we would bunker bunk like get up eat breakfast bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative full fu energy um between betw between me and the person writing it and and theres like probably like a xxx a day that i remember where its just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on what i was working on and and and working with the person i was working with and like just like i felt like it yeah i guess that was the the last time that was that was like eh more than a year ago though but i guess its hard to hard to think that i havent been really truly happy since then but when youre making a movie like you dont you cant allow yourself to be happy really real especially if youre doing it you know basically by yourself with wi with like xxx like cant its too much else to do so i would say that im very accepting acce like accepting of other people and always eh im very empathic em empathic em empathic um and open o open ope like excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and yeah um hmm um i guess i wish i was less uh uh less ruled by fear more fearless f more fearless in my you know everyday interactions and in my like um you know zest for for living um sigh yeah i xxx i other things i would change about myself id i would i dont know laughter hmm really badly about myself um sigh i think there are numerous nu numerous instances in my childhood in which my like uh like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of um some sort of uh conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always always on the other side of the court you know like never it was i i noticed or noticed as i got older that other people other parents were like if their kid was in trouble like there was something wrong with with like their kid was perfect theres something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite um in particular my mom so i would say that there a couple of instances in which um i was like blamed or like you know it was my it was my fault um when when what i was doing like yeah its just thing things things that i couldnt like theres no yeah i dont know yeah ten years ago um stay stake you know like i i think that theres um i have a tendency to like i love lo love the fact that i have a tendency to get really caught up in ideas ide in an idea and like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes um ideas are too easily xxx i would just say like do as much as possible like dont dont decide that you um are only going to do one thing um try to like i guess i wouldve taken up like some done do taken piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums wouldve been drums more than reading music i would say id love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes um as far as like cause i was always really into directing so i was always directing actors and stuff but i didnt its only now that i um i dont know i guess stay uh dont stay sta stay stay focused fo yeah i dont know thats a tough tough question que tough question ellie thats it sure goodbye bye
synch yes okay from santa monica uh the people mostly sigh well the people also laughter laughter uh no not a lot well i cant afford to travel as much as id like to mm i was an english major uh i just liked reading a lot at the time so it sounded like the best thing well the most fun thing to study no not anymore oh i guess my dream job would be to manage a uh soccer club oh itd be pretty much impossible for me um i dont have any experience laughter in that field im very shy i play music sigh what do i do when im annoyed i dont know um what do i do when im annoyed i cant think of anything i dont know i dont think yeah i dont do anything specifically uh pretty good i would say very good i dont lose my temper very often mm when was the last time i argued with someone sigh i cant remember uh yeah i dont have a lot of conflicts with people i cant remember the last time i argued with someone sigh well lets see when i was um a little kid i was outside my grandparents uh restaurant and there was a robbery and i saw it i well i saw it when when the robbers were leaving um yeah maybe i would want to erase that from my memory if i could well i didnt know what was happening in that moment so i didnt feel so bad at the time but i felt bad afterward because then um you know my mother was upset by it my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was it was disturbing to see her you know really disturbed that way but at the time that it actually happened i wasnt really upset it was more the the aftermath of it mm it was wa it was laughter sigh situation that sniffle sigh i dont know um well i can think of um theres probably a million situations that i wouldve laughter i wish i wouldve handled differently i cant think of one in particular um maybe i think that when i was a kid i um well i think that when i was lets see well i have okay i have a good one um i didnt marry the girl that i think that i should have married so thats a big one for me yeah well we w we were together for about four years and uh i think i just took her for granted and i just didnt uh commit and um that was a long time ago and now thats its been so many years i realize well i dont know that if its a realization but i think now that that yeah she shouldve been my wife that we were meant for each other or made for each other but because my selfishness and because i just uh had this fear of commitment at the time i just felt like i didnt uh i didnt do what i shouldve done what what the smart thing wouldve been sigh well the last thing i can think of that i would say i feel guilty about was sigh no i feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships ive not i dont feel like im as as good of a friend as i could be but then at the same time i dont really know exactly what uh how i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that im not that i cant help people anyone who who has a problem i cant i never feel like i can help anyone who i know who has a problem so oh that happens every day i guess it that happens with everyone who i know and everyone all of my relatives and all of my friends i dont feel like i can really give them anything or help them in their lives you know well theyre um its very distant its its just its very cordial and its very uh uh i dont know what the word is its on the its kept at a very surface level i dont think that they know i dont think that my family really knows me very well at all and uh i dont know them very well either not not in a not in a true sense so yeah its its i think a lot of families are that way but it it is it does bother me that mine is that way oh its very easy i sleep a lot and i um yeah i i i have no problem sleeping at all no not not really i would say they way i am now its the way i think ive been my whole life so even when i was a little kid i slept a lot also and no i dont think ive ive changed much mm pretty down but like i said in a way i could say yeah im feeling really down but then again ive always been this way so its hard to say thats its down when its consistently that way yes a long oh a long time ago i was um about ten years old or around there about uh i was just missing a lot of school i didnt wanna go to school so eventually uh they sent me to to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and uh it went from there no i havent gone to therapy since i was a teenager well i didnt feel it was helping me at all so one day i just decided i didnt wanna go anymore eh uh well like i said it i didnt feel that it helped me um so i guess it i dont know that it affected me much no i wouldnt say disturbing no mm well i feel pretty happy whenever i see my nephew and uh i have a my best friends children are i feel like theyre my my nephew and my niece and im pretty happy when im around them uh my ideal weekend would be um i would travel tr i would probably be traveling i i would really enjoy just getting out of the city every weekend um eh going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city uh just seeing the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go i really do think people are different when you go to different places and how they interact with you and how they see the world different food um and i also like historical places i im into history and i and i enjoy um just visiting anywhere that has some sort of a historical significance laughter oh i havent taken a trip in a long time um the last trip i really took was i went to france a few years ago for a wedding and i had a really good time there and i had always wanted to go to paris and so i got to go to paris and then i went to a little town um thats a few hours away from paris where the actual wedding was and yeah it was really fun i think the the church where the wedding was was uh like a thousand years old so yeah it was a really cool trip sigh sigh like i dont know i dont laughter i dont know whats what would would be considered memorable uh a memorable experience probably the most memorable experience i guess would just be nothing in particular but but living with the girl who i just who i told you earlier that i think now that we shouldve gotten married um thats something that stays in my memory thats why im saying its memorable because its its still with me and um eh its something that i dont think you know well ill know ill never forget it but its not any mm particular day or any particular moment you know oh a lot um wish i could be healthier for one thing uh more energetic and um more friendly well no i think i am pretty friendly but more uh more outgoing more social s more uh more social um those two things mainly i guess i would like to be more more social more enthusiastic and more and healthier oh thats a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me i think i think he would say that im a very sigh well it sounds cheesy but it laughter he would probably say that im a very spiritual person and that im very giving i i think im a lot more selfish than people think i am but people think that im not selfish um and probably he would say that im creative also sigh wow well my advice to to myself i dont understand the question laughter yeah but we already talked about it sigh nah i cant uh well i dont think that i really believe in in being proud or in in pride um i dont think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but i cant really think of any accomplishment anyway even if i did have something laughter to be proud of no i cant think of anything anythi any sort of accomplishment ive had sigh uh something i did recently that i really enjoyed well i sang karaoke with a couple of friends of mine laughter and i dont usually do that but yeah i had a that was a lot of fun a few days ago thank you    
synch sure im doing fine im from columbia south carolina yep uh two thousand four yeah laughter uh once a year for christmas break uh a lot slower paced more xxx i wanted to perform perf to pursue a film degree or im sorry a film career yes its pretty challenging but its uh fun uh ive always had a interest inter interest in uh film and movies so uh it seemed like a natural pick for me uh took about a couple of years but uh i feel like im pretty used to it now uh i like that uh it doesnt snow its warm weather and theres lots do to with a lot of beaches uh the traffic and the cost of living is pretty high laughter ive never been outside of the us but uh i would love to at some point uh it depends on the situation i i can either be introverted or extroverted just given uh the right circumstance i like uh listening to music uh doing crossword puzzles reading and hanging out with friends on weekends uh very good hmm uh i dont think it was argument maybe may maybe a difference of opinion so it was more like a debate but uh it was pretty pretty tame uh i think it was a debate over sports over a basketball ba a basketball game and uh i was talking on facebook with somebody about it but i think its good to uh express yourself if you have a difference of opinion its uh its natural to you know not always agree on things so i think talking ta talking about is healthy hea is healthy i have a very good relationship with my family um i get along with all of my family members and extended you know cousins and aunts and uncles so uh theres no one that i ive ever had any rifts with hmm with my family hmm i probably couldve been more disciplined growing up and more uh more disciplined with schoolwork and homework that kinda thing but for the most part uh i had a i had a good childhood and uh theres not much i would change about it hmm probably leaving my comfort zone in uh south carolina moving out here that was pretty hard but at the same time it was uh exciting so it was it was a bittersweet feeling um a lot of excitement mixed with uh some anxiety but it uh it went away pretty quickly sure not doing better in school uh when i was in high school uh definitely i couldve been a a ss um more diligent worker and i couldve uh applied myself a little bit better hmm ive always had a strong support s uh family support system and uh parents and uh siblings so thats definitely a positive thing hmm an event uh probably going back to school i wish i wouldve uh wish i wouldve done better in school so if i could take something back from my past it would be uh scholastically sch scholastically related its pretty easy when i dont sleep well um i tend to be kinda lackadaisical and uh just tired throughout the day kinda groggy uh no everythings pretty much uh the way it usually is with me ive been feeling pretty good uh no i have not uh no i havent last time i felt really happy um i made a lot of money uh a few weeks ago and uh i feel like im ahead of the game with you know with having rent under control and a lot of bills out here so im still kinda have the lingering effects from that happiness yeah uh when i when i have money i tend to be a lot uh more eventempered not eventempered but i tend to feel better about things and more optimistic and this city being such about your finances it it always makes you feel good to be ahead of the game and to have uh xxx have sources of income uh i think im creative and i think im a good listener hmm to be as disciplined and focused as possible because once youre out of your parents homes and out of their lives you have to depend on yourself and the better the better you do in school and the better you are um uh as far as disciplines concerned the more pleasurable pleasur pleasurable your life will be and a lot eh uh your life will be a lot easier hmm lets see here i wish i was more disciplined but im working on that and ive gotten a lot better at that its become pretty easy i think im just getting older um im out of my twenties now so i definitely seen a change from when i first came out here hmm um some people tend to say that my decision to move out here was uh not feasible and kind of a pipe dream so that kinda made me feel bad but uh i kinda take insults in stride and um sometimes i welcome constructive criticism cause some some things are wrong with you that youre not aware of so as long as its not meanspirited and its coming from the right place i think it could be an invaluable uh tool you know listening to what to what other people have to say that might be negative hmm uh probably optimistic and um outgoing optimistic and uh helpful my ideal weekend uh i would love to go to vegas and have a road trip with with three or four friends you know packed in the car and just uh lots of disposable income and um you know good weather uh i havent been to vegas in probably five years but um ive gone to casinos with my brother and thats pretty fun sometimes uh im proud that ive come a long way from when i first moved out here im uh a lot more disciplined um i read a lot uh i do crosswords and i think ive i think i know whats important in life now and im more focused and going after what i want hmm im not a big fan of high taxes um but it doesnt really make me mad it makes me frustrated and and uh i guess i take it in stride though uh i had a friend over at my apartment and i watched a movie and that was fun it was a documentary a sport s a sports sure goodbye
sync yeah im totally fine it be confidential or not you know my words wo my words are everybodys get wild laughter im doing pretty good hanging out nice weather um i just had a recent change of feeling just now looking at you laughter the the digitial you that im saying uh i dont know its yeah its funny um tisk because i just always thought that uh the conveying of emotions or feelings uh  be like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non human entity such as yourself yeah i i think you see what i mean laughter im from um born and raised in los angeles venice area mar vista specifically um thats where im from um well  theres a lot more that i dont like but what i do like is  that public transportation is coming up uh  that the idea of  certain you know medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent you know topic very  thought upon and i feel that los angeles deep culture is um why i stay here and pursue my art because theres a lot to theres a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand laughter yeah um well the the human mentality here is um is very very hectic very chaotic you know a lot due to the vehicle the car the freeway and this idea that were on a grind you know this yeah its its a very its its very hectic um atmosphere human atmosphere that is not very conducive for a supporting loving community to help each other out kind of thing yeah well i cant see your shoes laughter but um i love to travel i do love hiking i do love surfing swimming biking riding taking rides uh laughter i do love to travel yeah um from my travels its not like well i do enjoy a lot of things about travel but its more like what do i its its just more like i i enjoy not being uh trapped in the city with all these uh made up ties and restraints i enjoy traveling because i get to see the world as it really is instead of this uh faux image you know man ma man made image that it is here so i love traveling because i get to get out of this and see the world as it is thanks laughter would you laughter okay laughter um well i um kind of recently last year went to los banos central california area and although it wasnt that far from la it was completely different energy um there was no phones  there was no wifi theres no tv there was um there was sanity there was a relative sanity  in the sense that um people werent diluted and getting all of this input from digital media and  outer influence people were just raw real and hiking and chilling I was working at a hot spring resort and i just got to breath and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry yeah um not hard you dont you dont even think about difficulty when youre doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasnt um i guess uh kind of what i described about the city i just wanted to uh get out of here and kind of kind of just get out of here really and just experience the real the real deal yeah um well currently im studying um currently im studying physical therapy im about to become a licensed massage therapist but before that yeah kind of cool but before that i was going to scrubbedentry  um for music composition so i was just writing scores for  films animations dance productions theater productions stuff like that yeah it was it was cool it was fun trippy  very trippy um but it was cool but i had to leave that because  tuition hikes up to you know going up to like fifty thousand a year for like a four year bfa is uh not not the deal not trying to  trap myself with these uh chains of federal loans so yeah hey thats not a good word sucks laughter um dream job hm my dream job would be anything exhale that i can do to alleviate these uh metropolitan like cities from the nightmare that theyve been put in my dream is to alleviate the nightmare my dream is to incite dream back within the modern human world and with you know physical therapy and artistic expression ive got some great ideas laughter yeah um i guess more outgoing i just like i just like experiencing things so outgoing yeah    laughter i thought that was really funny um what i do to relax is uh just kind of breath it out chill maybe make a smoothie or some tea and i go bike riding write yeah hmm pretty good i guess i havent yelled in a long time um well it wasnt arguing i dont i dont really argue much i just like to state my opinion  and have it be understood and i like the person that im conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was uh i guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from new york and we were talking about writing and basically we were not arguing but talking about opinions and that sometimes things are not ready to be written yeah so yesterday hm guilty thats tough i havent had that feeling in a long time guilt what about you whats something you feel guilty about laughter okay mm i dont really wish i could erase anything from my memory cause then that would just be like i would feel something was lacking from my current present life if something just got erased you know butterfly effect kind of like yeah hmm um maybe the time scrubbedentry um she was going to school i was taking the year off and i was just kind of hanging around um but we had an apartment together with another friend and it didnt turn out you know not all nothing turns out as its thought to be and thats kind of the beautiful thing about it but this one turned out a little uh a little different actually quite different than i thought it would be and i thought it was funny but yeah it ended up uh me leaving before the lease ended and that actually ended up yeah with us separating but thats something i wish uh maybe i handled a little more thoughtfully the hardest decision huh hm maybe maybe not the hardest but a hard decision i had to make was leaving school dropping my uh continuation of achieving being a bfa yeah that couldve been the hardest um its just uh i dont i mean of course money money is the motto moneys a big issue tution hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan of support s not a fan of support that but um yeah thats probably one of the biggest reasons why i just dont support these crazy tution hikes going around and um but another reason why i decided to leave i had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was  also because um art institute you know um thats a thats a funny idea in itself already and basically i was a musician being taught by a musician to make music and same with you know all the all the dancers or the theatre students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know and its just um yeah its just not quite as artistic as i thought art would be art shh art comes from somewhere uh somewhere sweet and deep and purple and uh not not from out there you know so yeah hm if i if i um its kind of easy i mean it depends you know if i remember to make some chamomile tea or if i remember to breathe and go through my mantras or remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then i can get into it real nice um but if i just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until i remember to breathe yeah um yeah basically just what i said just breathing or you know if im hanging out with friends coming home late and if i get the lucky chance to be uh medicated from you know a nice a nice indica um then it really does you know indica does put me down pretty nice pretty drowsy so a lot of things breathing you know mm you know medical herbs uh like chamomile and cannabis and just uh going just relieving myself of bad bad juju laughter mm mm i i guess not if i cant think of something no ive been feeling kind of like kind of like this kind of just cruising on a on a grey line but its a nice grey its a really nice hue um some people wouldnt like this but i really like that and its uh its stable yeah its its comfortable yeah no no i havent not by a certified um medical professional no but no i havent laughter um yeah i mean i just think like the whole you know like you said ptsd depression and you know other you know mental instabilities i think everybody is depressed i think everybody is overjoyed i think everybodys angry i think everybodys shy everybodys social all at the same time you know its just different days different you know variants different floats different boats you know different waves different swells um so yeah i think im depressed i think im really happy i think im really angry i think im really friendly you know all that but just on different variants different floats really happy um i i mean i feel really happy a lot uh and i feel really sad a lot but really happy was uh i guess maybe this morning when i just biking over here just enjoying the sun enjoying the breeze biking yeah it is laughter um well i have a lot of best friends and they describe me all all pretty differently but underlying that same idea that maybe im just uh maybe in a nutshell just kind of aquarius i guess well im twenty one so twenty years ago laughter i wouldve told myself to keep being a baby uh stay young and dont lose sight you know dont stop listening keep letting things happen dont make them happen be be a beautiful baby thats what i wouldve told myself or yeah be a beautiful baby mm um well i guess recently what has been shown to me uh through me by me is um my ability to work with others and im mainly speaking in an artistic standpoint ive been uh collaborating a lot with artists working on a lot of different um mediums mixed media projects and im really comfortable with it and with other peoples and melting our ideas together yeah mm thats a weird question like um like thats trying to make me single out the you know one moment that i today reflect upon and think about like its some past glory that im not capable of fulfilling today so i think the proudest moment of my life is right now chiling hanging with you yeah thank you mm its interesting um  my immediate family is uh mother father younger sister older brother older brother is in south asia just kind of backpacking around uh younger sis shes really chill

basically like music and going forcing myself to go to like different social related events yes depressed mm just but basically just depressed uh keeping myself locked in not talking to anyone uh uh i guess a few days ago okay well basically i feel that the best way to keep people in my life is having fake people in my life by playing online multiplayer games with avatars and user names and everything and i just have some uh fun going into virtual worlds with these avatars and talking to people that way so they dont know who i really am they dont even know my real name okay well my ideal weekend uh let me see is uh if im not working that weekend i will get up maybe go to like starbucks or a mcdonalds get online while eating or drinking something maybe play a online multiplayer game for a little while and then later on in the day maybe go to a movie uh whatevers playing then uh go someplace else relax watch some tv um and maybe put on a dvd movie and um or i might spend the day i the whole day driving to someplace i  havent been before or its been a long time since ive been just try to spend the day in that area and just yeah so thats the weekend my life i just regret how my life turned out i wish i wish i had a more normal stable life uh let me see ten twenty years ago i was especially uh i would just tell myself to keep a journal or something s uh or  to basically tell myself how my life will turn out now so that way hopefully the other me will make different choices uh my mind well i wish i wish i was a bit healthier i wish i looked a little bit better i wish my eyesight was a lot better and i wish i had a bunch of people in my life that i could call friends um im a freaking genius i could uh everything that im good at i learned self taught so basically i

sync yes good how are you los angeles uh weather entertainment traffic no too t too many people business uh just fun thing to do yes nothing much to talk about hm maybe talking to you um pretty good environment pretty good the middle sleep i dont know dont remember no nothing really um i dont know i cant remember um bad people you know just bad people doing back things uh car accidents mm dont dont know any of them dont really know any uh nobody no no somewhat okay just waking up thinking no i i dont know no i dont know hm dont dont remember i i dont know talking to you first time ive done this before i have no idea sleep not too much nothing dont have any experience um i dont know not sure um just be a nice person not sure nothing much no i dont know i dont know i dont know play sports basketball mm last month goodbye
synch yes oh um fine a little tired but uh i found out my thyroid is i think acting up so laughter i was born in canada and but ive lived in california most of my life so and its grey today too so the grey weather makes you kinda um you know sluggish the laughter oh my gosh years and years ago uh not at all i dont think ive gone back there laughter for a long time well the airfares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so travel as much as its a fun thing to do its cost prohibitive so uh huh oh lets see everything has plus and minuses um cold weather laughter not as much sun so i think id prefer getting more sun and having the warm weather so but other than that its um its very pretty back there natural scenery and but uh i like it here and you know the traffics kind of heavy but thats a small thing to deal with so mhm why did i move to la because my family came here and started uh my dad got a job here and this became our home base and uh thats why easy very easy so uh huh uh well in high school you generally study general ed yeah its they have designated courses and then after that went to college and i was a business major lets see i was a veterinary major laughter and uh i graduated with a degree in liberal arts so um i dont know cant really pinpoint why laughter so i was working in social services but ive also worked in sales and most recently im doing real estate im a leasing consultant part time i mean everything has plus and minuses its its okay its not i dont really see too many negatives oh probably to work as a uh gossip columnist at tmz or one of those networks laughter but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive its who you know so but that would be my dream job or probably working with uh cats you know animals so im very outgoing in fact i think im so outgoing i scare people sometimes theres a lot of quiet you know reserved people out there so im kinda east coast very you know i go up to people and talk to them very social laughter laughter laughter oh my gosh theres i could do hundreds of things i could read i could watch a show turn on the music music is great um take a walk uh call my friends million things laughter so im pretty good im very good i mean you know of course when youre driving in la and somebody cuts in front of you sometimes that can be irritating but im im actually pretty im not the type of person that will fight or get i dont like to have confrontations so mhm mm i cant really remember so as i said theres not very many arguments usually i avoid arguments at any cost sigh so i dont really feel guilty about anything laughter right now or that i can think of mm i cant think of anything right now i really cant think i of any decisions that were really hard i mean most its pretty easy for make me to make a decision so i dont have a family so if i have to you know i had to move san s  to san francisco for a job once but since im single its i dont really have to consider other people and children and that type of thing so it kinda makes certain things easier when you dont have a family to consider mm yeah an event hmm well obviously you dont you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever so i know when my father died you know i mean i wish i wouldve had him for a lot longer i mean he died at the age of seventy seven and you know wouldve been nice to have him around a little bit more but you know cant control those things life has its own way of dealing with that so mhm yes there are laughter yin and yang thats ancient uh philosophy and it really applies theres pluses an minuses and negatives and positives so well as i said my dads no longer here and my mother and i you know we have our differences i think mothers and daughters always do um my brother and i get along great i see him a lot i see s my sister works a lot i see her and you know we talk and shes kinda got her own life and her children i get along great with them so mhm we have a small family uh laughter once again its like thats a hard question to answer theres so many types of kids out there i think majority of them seem to be pretty wellbehaved i mean you know theres always gonna be children that are kinda out of control but um i dont know the ones that ive seen recently theyre very wellbehaved so cant say much else about that well laughter i live in an apartment laughter and i dont know if youve ever lived in apartment but um uh theres someone that lives above me im on the first floor and theres somebody on the second floor and theyre pretty quiet but they have a habit of laughter i guess they have lots of energy um they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes theyll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes run through the bedroom wall laughter so laughter so it sounds like niagara falls in there and uh so i dont yeah and i need eight hours of sleep and ive only been getting ooh id say like maybe six hours and then i usually wake up once at night too cause sometimes theyll kind of around two or three in the morning theyll either walk around or ill hear something so im not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and its definitely laughter but theres not like i said theres things you cant control when you live in an apartment you know i mean the the ladys uh very quiet its just that she has a habit of you know taking later showers laughter washing clothes at night thats i cant say anything to her about that so yeah but you know theres people that are in worse situations so i dont make a lot out of it you know and i just its not like every night but its you know at least twice a week so i you know i have to consider maybe sleeping laughter in another room but for now you know thats ill deal with it so tired laughter very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done cause i dont have my energy also i havent been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but the weathers been kinda colder and kinda drearier so you know im not as motivated when the weathers kinda blah so its a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep mhm uh as i said before um tired laughter im i its a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now were have been having very grey days i live very close to the ocean so the sun doesnt come out that much so im not getting my serotonin laughter i need that i um im not getting my eight hours of sleep because you know whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so thats kind of creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies and you know once the sun comes out im kinda more energetic it just gives you that more energy so no mm mm no i am im happy most of the time im a pretty happy person and i like to be around other people i mean of course i like my private time but i do like being around people quite a bit so hmm laughter cant think of anything right now i mean i usually enjoy everything i do theres nothing that stands out more than anything else so no i never regret anything uh huh what advice would i have given well i guess yeah i could probably change things around i think it everybody could um i probably wouldve had a different college major um you know seems like laughter uh what else um i probably wouldnt have dated certain men laughterum wasted time with certain people um i dont know those are the things that come to mind maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things but mm outgoing lots of fun to be with um uh just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend im loyal trusting and uh i listen im a good listener im very patient laughter as well so mhm well laughter number one would be to lose weight but i think thats a worldwide problem i mean theres a lot of food around and temptations and um especially here in america a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we you know its just easy to relax rel its so easy to relax you know its hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so thats the weight you know has gives you more energy too if you lose weight so thats a big thing as well but thats probably the thing just the weight thing yeah mhm i think you mightve asked me that question before laughter but uh if you want ill repeat it so um im very uh like i said im very loyal uh when i tell people im gonna do something i do it very reliable uh i im warm im very friendly im um great listener and i you know ive heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like i said im very im pretty upbeat you know im dont d i dont let things get me down too much so hmm thats a hard question laughter the cant think i mean im cant think of to answer that one laughter so laughter for fun well i love movies i could see every movie that they make um i love going out with my friends shopping swapmeets um my gosh and traveling is great road trips um thats kind of you know part of it yeah that i mentioned so traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it um the foods enjoying foods in diffferent countries uh the architecture its just kinda neat to get away and see a completely different place mhm okay well laughter ive um been to a lot of places in europe i love paris uh its such a walking city you can whoever designed that city ill tell ya i mean its you can get from one point to another the subways are great um each area has its own distinctive kind of theres the latin quarter where the students are theres another area where lets say the fashion designers are um kinda like our rodeo drive here in beverly hills theres an area that is more african af african and they have swapmeets on the weekends that are wonderful for international and then like i said once you get out of paris theres just so much history you can go see versailles then theres other palaces you can go to the south of france you know its but thats probably my favorite country ive been to italy as well so uh yeah well after college people usually i mean people that go to college or either before or after college thats a great time to go to europe because youre young and youre not tied down you dont have a family and um you kinda have a more adventuresome spirit  you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases is not laughter not a big deal um so yeah thats mhm yeah laughter mhm thank you goodbye

idea id like to do um some s make some robe r ah like a robe line um womens robes and things like that mhm i have ive traveled quite a bit and i enjoy en i love travel um seeing different cultures different countries um meeting new people all of that and the language um i lived in greece for um tisk over a year i taught english there and um sniffle i moved around to different parts of greece and uh really had a great time i think um just having my group of friends that i met there and going through with the experience with them um i think one of my most memorable experiences was going to elafonisos in a car with everybody and um and having a just a fantastic time yes it was um i think im shy to begin with and um and as i get to know people then im much more outgoing photography and language studies laughter deep breath um i just stay at home uh maybe watch a movie um rest in bed watching a movie in bed thats probably one of the things that i like to do to relax i think very good laughter deep breath um it was probably with my boyfriend um uh regarding money issues um i need to i feel guilty about not generating as much income as i need to right now im having some struggles in my career right now and um financially its becoming very difficult yeah it has been its been difficult but ive been working very hard to um to remedy that sigh so well im here and um im doing this this focus study im doing um many things to generate more money working harder but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my my career um probably being raped no no sometimes um not that im aware of deep breath um i been feeling stressed sigh um i been feeling um deep breath been feeling stressed and and worried i dont seem to have any problem with it laughter i seem to get a good nights sleep almost every night mhm um grumpy and and lethargic and um in the morning hmm a situation i wish i would handle differently um i really cant think of one right now laughter the hardest decision um that ive ever had to make it was probably um deciding to not have a a child well um i was pregnant um and um wasnt sure sigh whether or not i should continue the pregancy um and that was also due to financial burden and um the father who i was involved with did not want the child so i made that very very difficult decision hmm deep breath really really happy sigh i know when i went to um cancun um on a holiday um over the new year um new year period new year holiday deep breath i felt sigh absolutely fantastic i felt happy i felt relaxed um i felt like i didnt have a care in the world temporarily um eh free deep breath um i wish i could um be a little bit stronger and more assertive definitely more assertive um i would say im a wonderful wonderful friend um mm i when i love

of my best qualities deep breath um my relationship with my family um with my father is not so great um my parents were divorced when i was young and hes sort of been in and out of my life you know

pier um and spending some wonderful time with them and making them happy that was probably a great time um one of the best times in the last few weeks scrubbedentry and uh and theyre theyre great kids um no i think the theyre its challenging um it is more difficult because theyre stepchildren so there are some um times when im not sure exactly how much um to get involved and how much not to get

made it make a make a conscious effort not to um laughter not to punish them um or overpunish them i make a conscious decision not to um scream at them the way that i was screamed at i was screamed at

to live somewhere different and a nicer warmer climate and um somewhere where theres a lot more to do and theres a lot more going on for me it was really easy cause i wanted something someth it was very different and i wanted something different i like um i like all the things to do like the museums i like the beaches and the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do mm people dont appreciate what they have here that just come here and wanna take something but they dont wanna give anything back and bad drivers uh not as much as i would like to i travel whenever i can but usually cant afford to that much mm well i like taking i like taking pictures a lot and i just like exploring new places my wife and i like to see um wildlife and hike and monuments and just seeing different areas um well sigh we weve gone go we went to uh central california wed like to be able to go more internationally places but that takes awhile to afford so weve gone more locally so we went to um we went to hurst castle and to see the sea lions li the um the elephant seals and things like that um i guess our uh i guess our palm springs trip for our anniversary we did the um eh we did the tram and a nice hotel and jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall i guess somewhere in between english and film well i uh was told i needed to go to college and i hadnt quite decided what to do yet so i just picked something i liked to do for the time being well wish id not been pressured so i had more time to figure out what i wanted to i mightve done something different like physical therapy but uh no ive been teaching t teaching gymnastics which is something i used to do before um i needed to not starve and i did it i didnt end up being as bad as i thought it would be so i went for it and it ended up being kinda fun dream is to have money and not have to work for it overall pretty good um dont remember what about but it probably wouldve been few weeks ago with my wife um well anyone that ive ever actually gotten upset and yelled i always wish i wouldnt do that but sometimes when someones not listening it drives me crazy um you know if i just saying something over and over and theyre just clearly not listening it makes me really upset um sigh i dont know i i spend a lot of time on em but i dont i dont know what the hardest one is cause eh if i decide to go with something its you know its usually for a good reason well i guess i feel guilty about moving to california and that i left my family in virginia i mean pft i know i shouldnt but they always seem to miss me and even though they dont like living there you know im the one that moved away so its like i abandoned them well i mean i dont miss virginia but i do miss them so i guess a little hard uh i have a good relationship with my deep breath with my wife with my inlaws with my mom dad and sister theres no problems everyone gets along well mm very close um i mean anything anyth anything where someone gets hurt either uh physically or otherwise it depends on how much exercise i have get a lot of exercise its pretty easy if i dont its not um kind of like right now just a

gonna go back after this so not a lot of time to sleep mm just um just uh slower sl just slower and more tired and little more out of it thats all no no um usually just when im having havi having a fun day either on my own or with my wife thats thats pretty easy for me just getting outside and and uh and hiking or exercising its not hard for me im not sure maybe um maybe mm like eccentric but in a good way hopefully no um to be careful with your to be careful with your job to make sure you could keep from being injured and to um i dont know just your y just your normal your normal kind of uh older kinda wisdom sigh mm not much to say really everyone realizes things when they get older that they wish they had when they were younger uh i wish i could get rid of my back injury so i could get back into shape like i used to be thats um the biggest thing right now um not much to say just hurt my back at work and i just like to get past it cause its you know holding me back from doing a lot of things thats all um well like i used to do uh gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now i can only work out a little bit cause it hurts too much um probably like during the during the day going sigh going on a hike or to a park with my wife and uh enjoying taking pictures and wildlife and exercising and then at night um you know we watch a movie

time i enjoyed it ooh it was a an everyday thing people were friendly uh finding out that some of the things about my grandmother and her family were interesting snort uh i studied uh poly sci and uh sociology uh sigh well at the time it seemed like the easiest thing to do no no uh sigh well i had my dream job for a while i was doing sports research for uh native american tribes snort but uh yeah i enjoyed it but thats uh its not as uh as often as it was clears throat mainly because of the uh the sports bureaus that exist now that didnt exist when i started i still when i do i still enjoy it uh sigh snort ill be what wh what ill be what suits me in any given situation uh listen to music uh i like oldies jazz mm soft music uh ive learned to do it well i wasnt wasnt always that way but ive learned to do it well snort by when by arguing i assume you mean words uh with my youngest daughter it was about uh a year and a half ago uh well it was it stemmed over an incident i didnt like what the the way her husband said something to her and it bothered me and when i told her she got extremely defensive and rather than deal with it she became she became angry with me snort i was mad uh three girls thirty eight thirty seven thirty one uh three granddaughters eleven fourteen eighteen so i havent won an argument in a long time but i adore all six of em uh well now i dont really consider myself a parent snort since mine are grown my baby is thirty one and you never lose that but i mean im not parenting at this point  in my life im enjoying my grandchildren when i was a parent yeah its a difficult challenge snort is uh getting getting to their level and understanding what they understand and dont understand and not putting your your stuff in front of theirs the hugs well my dad was was physical uh in those days you know uh nobody called child services if you got hit uh uh my mother was very loving but my dad well you know he hed raise his hand to you if he thought it would it would uh disappoint you snort i never did that adored my mother sigh my dad uh was a hard guy but i loved him uh i never felt abused by him but i mean i the one thing i remember he said when you when youre capable of kicking my ass you can leave this house snort thats my thats kinda the the basis of our relationship my mother my kids my grandkids well im im one of im one of three sigh three sons clear throat so i really didnt have any experience with females other than uh with my mother in terms of being you know related and my grandma and then when my first daughter was born it was like wow snort that was it i fell madly in love with her changed my life yeah well thats the way it happened uh sigh when my mother got sick i i wasnt wa i wasnt there for her the way i shouldve been and i dont feel good goo oh yeah you can always fix what you did in the end snort i was just in a real bad situation but that doesnt excuse the fact that i wasnt there the way i sholdve been at least not in my mind uh sigh uh my second marriage probably she uh she wanted to have uh children and i already had my children with my first wife and uh i i had i had told her initially that i did not wanna have children and you know i had three uh that and i was good with that and she indicated that she did not want to have children sniff so we got married and then her best friend got pregnant and our relationship changed and i basically wouldnt relent and we ended up getting divorved uh i i i dont know that i wouldve had children chil wouldve wouldve had children with her but i i wasnt very flexible in the process what to be flexible i dont know sometimes i am sometimes im not uh thatd been pulling my uh pulling my father out of off uh uh life support i just kept going back to something he said to me when i was uh younger that he would come back and haunt me and if i you know if i let him lay there lay there and suffer it took me a while to convince my other two brothers but  thats what we did something i could erase from my memory uh being locked up for a while id like to erase that from my memory snort its just its an everyday hell where theres very little humanity and uh you even do some things that youre not proud of ive never slept ive never slept a lot and im one of those people that  if i wake up i have a hard time going back to sleep so its its difficult diffi its uh snort unless im really tired then you know sneeze im pretty much still the same i dont change so so i had friend f uh things are good with the kids and the grandkids except for the little incident with my granddaughter granddaugh uh my youngest daughter but i had a friend recently who was uh runned over in a crosswalk and uh hes on hes on life support so i havent been feeling too good about that its its affected me it wasnt like he was jaywalking or anything he literally was walking in the crosswalk and the guy never even hit the break so and hes on uh life support at this point mm no not really only consistent thing about me is im very inconsistent uh no no but ive had moments where i felt i was i was depressed okay i was talking when you were talking so i didnt hear the question uh uh yesterday had a conversation with my fourteen yearold granddaughter im happy i have moments of happiness every day cause i i either speak to or text with uh my daughters and granddaughters every day even if were upset with one another oh i have a lot of regrets uh i shouldve went to law school thats thats kinda something i thought yeah began to think about more in my lifetime i was accepted i just didnt i had other other things i thought i wanted to do snort uh sigh uh i i played with uh wanting to be uh uh a kicker for football on a football team had some tryouts things like that but they didnt pan out and as as that didnt pan out i sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer so i just did other things i dont think itd make that much difference i probably wouldnt listen to myself snort um about myself uh hums uh i could be uh if i dont like you i could be very uh very difficult if i dont like you id very much like to change that it has in the past yeah snort well i have this theory that you could make me feel bad about myself only if i let you and im not real big on letting let letting people do that to me uh although my first wife when when she left me with the children snort she you know that it was my fault and i wasnt sure that i believed that but i knew i was an ass and and uh but i probably believed it and not in its totality but in part snort sigh uh im very uh im not judgemental uh uh i would listen to anybody uh whether i agree with you or disagree with you uh uh ive taught myself to uh control anger that i that i have uh and uh if if ive called you my friend or if i tell you i love you uh i mean it its thats not something that i do uh casually snort uh oh okay well i i played eighteen holes of golf with a with an old dear friend and we got caught up and uh sigh we four hours on the golf course two hours at dinner met his new wife uh had a good time a lot of a lot of memories came back mm snort uh well i like i like my my kids ki uh my grandkids i like that you know i like the hell out of them i dont know if all kids are like that i i think they rely too much on uh rely too much on technology but but thats me mainly cause i dont but if my grandkids are any any uh sampling of it i think theyre good i think theyre pretty good snort uh sigh raising my girls basically by myself with the help of my mother i think thats the uh most proud of or okay nice chatting with you bye
sync yes im pretty good uh as far as my parents ethiopia yes um the beaches the warm weather um the diverse environment uh traffic laughter well im currently in school im studying african studies uh ive always been interested in african studies actually ive always wanted to help people and i figured that i could help them by trying to learn about it and going back to africa and make an influence kind of in between i have my shy moments but then when im around a group of people that i enjoy im pretty outgoing um to relax i normally write or i go to the beach and just sit there play my guitar pretty good i dont really get angry or anything like that i tend to keep it in or try to release it by writing um i actually cant remember the last time i argued with someone mm all the people ive hurt in the past uh ive like cheated on people hurt their feelings intentionally done things that i shouldnt have done that i regret now mm um well with my ex i couldve ended it better so we could be on better terms now um i probably shouldnt have argued so much or tried to instigate so many things i probably shouldve just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out um hardest decision ive ever had to make was man i really dont know actually um having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer um well he had a tumor that he had to get removed so it was just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really didnt want to be there cause hes a really live person and hed rather be running around and stuff like that but just seeing him stuck in bed was just terrible uh me and my family arent very close we dont i mean theyve always been there for me and i appreciate it but weve never had that close connection collection connection con connection um especially since theyre foreign so they dont really understand where im trying to come from having been grown up out in america so its pretty different when it comes to those cultural cu racial i mean the cultural boundaries that we kinda step each over each others feet on but aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does get kinda awkward but its okay i think they are out of control i think that theyre learning things that they shouldnt know at this age i think that theyre doing things that they shouldnt be doing and i dont feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldnt be doing it i feel like theyre being applauded by the media theyre being applauded by celebrities that they follow and theres not enough being done about it and theyre just getting lost um depends on the night some nights its pretty hard some nights i fall asleep like a baby um usually creative actually when i cant sleep ill just stay up and ill write something or read a book and ideas will pop up um stuff like that its usually a good thing when i cant sleep its nothing really bad cause im having bad thoughts or anything like that um lately between a mix of good and bad i have my happy moments when im energized and im live then some nights some days where im just you know just sitting there just mellow thinking not like my live self i dont know its just always been like that always have those ups and those downs but they kind of balance each other out no no um the last time i felt really happy was hm today uh just from the moment i woke up it was a beautiful sunny day i went to see some friends we had a good time went to school had some good grades on some papers um wrote a good essay feel pretty accomplished and i feel like my day is just a good day my best friend would describe me as odd laughter most people would describe me as odd i say a lot of odd things i do odd things im interested in things that most people arent um just like old literature um revolutionary stuff uh stuff about changing the world but through underground means um no i i dont live a life of regret to never let fear stop you from doing anything um reading just hanging out with some friends driving around finding something to do just going on an adventure i dont wish i could change anything about myself i just wish i could build myself into the person that im truly supposed to be um this one time me and my best friend got into an argument and she pointed out all the things ive done that i shouldnt have done all at one time how ive hurt people how ive hurt her the ways ive done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once i reflected on it all uh my parents i mean although we dont see eye to eye they always bring me to this realization that i need at the end of the day although i never listen to them or i dont choose to listen to them once it happens i learned from it and im like oh thats what my parents told me so i learned to trust them more and i learned to understand that they are wiser than me and they do know more than me um not so much anymore um i travel around la try to find new sights to see but as far as i dont travel outside um discovering new things um discovering things you never knew were there or the limitless possibilities um i discover i like i enjoy discovering new people new cultures new things that go against whats normal for us and for myself um a few days ago i just drove out to the middle of the desert and i just sat there and i just enjoyed all that the desert had to offer and it was just enjoyable um i felt free away from all this these cities and these buildings and it just felt nice to be out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time it felt good im most proud that ive always been different that despite how many people have told me that im really weird or im odd or i think weird things ive always maintained my original mentality

problem and i have to work to calm myself down and sometimes i just dont get on something and i dont stop sometimes but ive learned to control it to that extent now laughter yesterday i was arguing about what sort s what kind of water we should be drinking uh well a difference of opinion and i felt as though my opinion was very valid um even though uh the other partys opinion was somewhat misinformed um definitely uh every day is a growing process i wish i wouldve handled everything differently every day which is what um makes me grow and i try to work toward how i wouldve wanted to handle things every day little by little um sigh cant think of anyone right now um sigh id id id say uh not supporting my friends as much with their career choices sigh uh id rather not get into it

well uh they believe that um the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and this is true with many studies like t colin campbell the china study and um the sources of information that are uh that that are very good and i i think deserve respect based on you know real research laughter really easy ive uh almost got it down to a science uh im tired been feeling better than i have in a long time uh yeah i think its uh due to the transition in the diet and in no way having a placebo effect that its actually you know loosening up toxins and things that have accumulated over my short life time of um you know toxic choices with food and drugs or whatever it would be deep breath yes um less tense and less irritable and uh i have more clarity and more control over my uh decisions and my wants versus what i need that sort of thing nope yes to some extent uh over five years ago um sigh lack of motivation and basically my my symptoms were paralleling that of depression uh loss of appetite loss of motivation not wanting to do anything not wanting to be social at all having fear of uh social situations and uh xxx the main four or five no uh i believe i overcomed a chapter in my life that was the the doctor um you know taking control of my health and experimenting with drugs and i just sort of took another route which was alternative and i started juicing more and um just trying to listen to maybe what i needed with the help of uh the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that yes uh i believe therapy is useful because um sigh without looking inward or having somebody to help you do that um its very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that will just uh resonate in the subconscious until you you know it has an outburst it basically um therapy um will help in overall health and mental health i believe for everybody last night um i made a really great vegan uh dinner with you know meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot and i almost converted them laughter yeah uh i would say uh you know trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do like my brain likes caffeine and sugar whereas you know my body needs uh something other than that xxx is an example its very very hard its a daily process um i was uh handling money for uh a business partner and they ended up short and i was to blame but it was actually my formulas of crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change i made to the formula so the blame was on me that i may have took money and i i automatically felt bad about that because of my uneasy uh my uncertainty to the change of formula um no twenty years ago i was two years old ten years ago i was twelve years old i would tell myself to um to start eating raw fruits and vegetables every day as calm and um sad maybe smart talented laughter um i really enjoyed going to the uh wholesale food market in downtown los angeles um sigh lots of food uh great prices you can eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price as going to a normal supermarket so uh i i really get in a lot of enjoyment uh teaching people how to uh maybe better themselves especially foodwise and what theyre eating uh eating and um watching a really good tv show um im insightful i can uh i can adjust to peoples uh sigh uh sigh i dunno i guess ill skip that question for now im most proud of um sigh id say my overall situation with where im at right now i couldve never imagined that id be in such a fortunate um situation deep breath hmm sigh
sync yes im okay im good im a little tired but im good michigan im from michigan um a long time ago then i left uh once twice a year cold laughter very cold because i wanted to pursue my acting career uh well it wasnt a hard decision it was just it was the weather it was the opportunity it was the options more options uh the driving has been a pain in the butt not so easy sigh lets see besides the weather i like that things are more convenient i like some of the people here um laughter that are actually from home but um yeah i i just i like i like that its a little laid back thats about it i dont like the traffic i dont like um uh the gang violence in certain areas and i dont like sigh what else dont i like huh maybe thats thats all i dont like i dont oh you know i like i dont like that its so far away from home i wish i wish la was kinda midwest laughter i wish it wasnt so far from home i have a close relationship with my family um its a small uh immediate family is really small and were close my grandmother recently passed so its um tisk an adjustment right now but im close to my family well i cant see your shoes but i do travel often i do travel yes um getting there laughter i like getting there um once im at the wherever im going i like to actually do the tourist thing get to know places and people uh okay i oh i went to um france a few years ago well many years ago and a little town called carcassonne and was very um it was it was actually really fun but very much like a story book as far as what i expected to see and what i actually saw like i what i remember that i really enjoyed was that at night when everybody closes up like there are no windows in the buildings but they are these shutters that most places in the united states have inside of windows they have them outside of the windows and theres no glass so you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned like the buildings are abandoned so pretty cool sniff i like that laughter im borderline sometimes im shy sometimes im outgoing it depends on who  and what the situation is laughter um music i turn on music i walk through the neighborhoods you know im pretty good at controlling my temper im not a um hot head at all hm oh it was an ex roommate and it was about my loyalty as a friend yeah um pretty much she um thought that because i wanted my rent which she agreed to pay that i was not being a good friend that i should just let her live for free and that wasnt going to happen so you know the loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway even after she didnt pay me so thats a friend i couldve kicked her out i didnt she left at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay but you know couldve um couldve couldve been a bad situation but there was an argument there a real a real one i wish i had handled that situation differently and followed my first mind when we agreed to be roommates temporarily and um gotten my money upfront thats what i wish i had done and i just i didnt my mind told me to go along with it no my mind told me to get the money upfront but i didnt so mm the hardest decision um i think i have yet to make the hardest decision but so far like tisk maybe um leaving home leaving home when i was years ago when i was like eighteen yeah um i felt like i was abandoning my family laughter thats what i felt laughter but um they encouraged me to go on and live my life mhm uh something that i could erase from my memory probably a friend who i was um uh dating i would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when i told him my grandmother um was ill um its easy if im busy all day and im really really tired but actually my mind spins so its not that easy actually its not that easy id have to because i have to be exhausted i have to be exhausted to be exhausted no its not really hard you just do a lot of stuff all day long irritable up and down up and up and down like sometimes ive been excited and anxious and on the other side im like mm what am i doing yeah its just an anxiousness to wanna make some things happen some goals and um uh getting certain kind of work and um having a certain amount of um income and uh just taking care of myself you know the way i think i should take care of myself just the physical stuff eating right and everything yeah i have um sometimes i have a lot of distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what i need to be focused on in the moment and im conscious of that im like of all the things thats popping up in my head why am i thinking about that uh i i let them happen and then i i try to think about other things and phase it out it pops back up i phase it out yeah no no uh when the roommate moved out i was really happy when she finally left laughter um probably reading and maybe go out go dancing that would be ideal i can go dancing go salsa dancing and yeah mm my ability to make a decision quicker and to act on it really badly uh i dont know if i have a time that someone has ever made me feel really badly i dont feel bad about much uh as courageous that would be it in a nutshell laughter in general um i regret not making some different decisions when i was younger as far as moving forward with as far as um career stuff and um relationship things i wish i had done some things earlier in my life that im doing now uh really going after some of my personal goals and um deciding to actually be in a relationship thats long term and yeah i wish i had done that earlier laughter twenty years ago i would have giving given myself the advice to um continue with my schooling um beyond what i did and to be more discerning in my choices of individuals who i allow in my life um being a part of the family that im a part of laughter thank you goodbye
sync yes okay atlanta georgia um in two thousand and six never uh i dont like it there laughter oh its completely boring and theres very little to do la is preferable i think to most places uh because uh i was engaged to my fiancee and we lived in florida i moved there to be with him and um he loves the water but i love the mountains and i missed hiking and uh i didnt love florida and he wasnt tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere we could both be happy and also have um more opportunities in business and all of the great things that it has to offer very laughter very easy theres not much i dont like about la i love la um i think it feels magical uh so many creative different people of all ages um shapes sizes colors races um the mountains the water uh the city all the things that there are to do all the people there are to meet i just i love everything about la no uh id rather not talk about it um i didnt go to college im still figuring that out um i dont know it may may have something to do with animals i have a dog that i really love and i never had a dog um as an adult i had cats and uh um i think im a late bloomer so im working on that whole conversation i dont i really dont want a job i want a purposeful way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run it depends on the situation but in general i consider myself more shy although most people would consider me to be outgoing mm put on classical music laughter music classical music if im especially ex especially stressed and um play with my dog go for a walk i think im really good at controlling my temper for the most part um before i came here laughter um it was just about um financial stress uh um theres probably a lot of examples i think id rather move to another question yeah id rather not talk about that either laughter id rather not talk about that not very easy at all um a lot better recently but um i have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so its challenging um not to feel rested most of the time in the past week ive been feeling a lot better um yes i um the weather has changed spring has sprung its a little warmer i was having um more trouble with my depression in the winter and um having trouble with tolerating cold and so i wasnt doing  a lot of the things that i normally do and i also was sick with the flu um and in the past week i decided um that i was feeling better enough that i needed to kind of get out of my rut and start um getting more focused around things things that i need to do during the day and walking my dog  every day and um not isolating so much and seeing some of my friends more so i was seeing ive been feeling a lot better like ive been making progress and um that uh in the past week things have taken a more positive turn no yes uh its been quite some time officially its probably been i dont know exactly but lets see maybe more than fifteen years ago um i was feeling suicidal no um because i found a better alternative um i have been in therapy off and on since i was eighteen and ive tried a variety of um methods and then uh i started working with a neurolinguistic programmer and um that was really the first person that um helped me uh make permanent changes and i was able to get off my anti depressants as well and even though ive struggled with some bouts of depression its never been anything extremely severe and um it was one of the best things that ever happened well um i was physically ill with uh chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client that referred me to this person um because he had cured her of that disease and um that was um he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated so um once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me i was so happy um i felt like i some um i felt that i found the answer that id been looking for that  i hadnt given up hope and uh that um laughter i was on cloud nine that i i had been suffering for a a while wh a long time and i felt that i finally found the answer to the solution that i was looking for i was like it was the best thing i ever did in my life it was the best decision i ever made i felt extremely hopefuly for the first time in a long time laughter um i went to um i went to a music store because uh i had been thinking about um taking up an instrument i used to play the violin as a child and uh ive been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because i felt its been extremely repressed and um and so i went to the music store to try out um to see what it would feel like to um to handle an the instrument again  and see if i thought that that was something i wanted to pursue it was awesome laughter mm yeah id rather not talk about that laughter um well laughter theres probably a lot but um im always working on being more optimistic um its been challenging it takes time but um yeah i wish i could hear my own internal voice better laughter yeah i have regrets sure yeah um value myself more so that i would make better relationship decisions uh my fiancee is the most positive person in my life my ultimate supporter uh hes i think very unique not uh not at all selfish and uh probably a little too giving for his own good but um always has my best interests at heart has the highest morals of anyone i know would give somebody the shirt off of his back um is a genius in so many ways and uh um im pretty lucky i think that im not a quitter that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time i havent given up on taking risks and um
sync yes im doing really good im from granada hills california its um the san fernando valley part of los angeles i love the weather i like the diversity in people i like how you can go to a

antiques for a living laughter um getting passes press passes for the sunset strip music festival through a friend and getting to meet rockstars and hang out at like the private parties laughter im very outgoing i love people um i go to the gym and work out quite a bit i find it helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going i realized rea noticed if i dont work out a couple days i feel a little more tired than normal and it just helps me feel good im pretty good at it im very calm um i worked a lot of events and jobs where youre dealing with like thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to and you have to remain calm and you know theyre the customers so you have to make them feel wanted and good and realize that youre getting paid cause the money theyre spending so im good at resolving reso resolving like consumer conflicts and stuff on the job i had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and i kinda started getting loud like just telling her to stop doing that and that she was embarrasing and what she was saying to people was very mean you know and i wonder like if youre talking to people like that they might not like it and they could attack you or something you know you never know it is la laughter i really dont feel guilty about anything decisions ive made in my life ive think ive made really good decisions and i always stick with my moral compass what im doing i grew up in church so i havent gone in years but i still have those values and you know the rules the ten commandments and stuff in my head i had a slum lord landlord and um i wish that i called you know the proper authorities and followed through on a court case instead of letting him like kind of bully me out because it wasnt up to code i a few years back i was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back  to where he was from and after a few months you know he was coming to la and going back home i decided to move there and i had just started you know this business i was doing event planning was picking up and i decided to leave there and try to do it there and  you know on the east coast and it didnt work out but it was tough deciding like should i leave la and make this jump and trace something new and experience something new or stay in what i was doing i was i had a degree in dental assisting i did that for like a year i didnt like it and then i was studying communications like radio and television broadcasting and journalism um somewhat im doing event work and i wrote for a magazine a couple years and im trying to like get a website going and then have like where im controlling my own writing and whats going on instead of you know writing wri writing for someone else i always wanted to write and was always into the news and music and art growing up i really like connie chung she was like a channel four newscaster in the eighties and i love barbara walters i was a nerd no laughter um my sister she doesnt talk to any of the family and i have a good relationship with my mom um i never really knew my dad it doesnt bother me i have cousins and stuff but everyones scattered across the country so i dont really talk to them on the phone we just communicate on facebook  or like twitter oh i go right to sleep when i get tired i just go to sleep pretty good energetic ive been motivated to go look for more event work you know event planning stuff and really grinding in more than i was i mean its kinda hard cause you gotta talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else no no i mean im generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer or someone i know dies i wouldnt say that im just super like oh my god happy all the time but its like an even keel that i feel pretty good all the time im very talkative and friendly and i could approach strangers and talk to them at ease and i could adapt to different situations and even if i its not my scene or situation or group of people that im used to i could still jump in talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adapt i wanna make more money laughter laughter i remember in like second grade this people used to make fun of me cause i was very tall and skinny and i had like straight as one of the highest grades in the class so people would make fun of me and call me giraffe or stuff like that laughter very talkative she would just say that i talk to everyone laughter and that im very friendly and if you need help that ill help someone you know oh recently i went up to oceanside and visited a friend ive known years and we just went out for burgers and hung out on the beach and we got her two year old son and like took him to the park and played and it was really nice and it was cool visiting her i hadnt seen her in six months and it was really fun and i wanna go again and i like the area mhm i guess maybe i could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people i think i pursue it but i think maybe i could put a little more time a day into it i dont really know anything like that i would wanna erase or not happen no i feel good about my choices ive made and i think im on the right path and a lot of things i wanted to do then balls rolling and im getting g you know getting things done im not as big as i wanna be but i feel like im on my way there um like ten years ago i wouldve told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as i was um my friend we call mojo laughter um mojo has a magazine and i just wrote years and he really pushes me to like keep writing and keep doing events and keep on the ball im rolling and hes one of the biggest people you know in my life telling me youre talented you could do it you know hes just a really good like motivation for me laughter you know being published ive been on tv shows and just getting my own event thing going and i have a lot of people who read what i write every day and follow on i just think its a you know its not exactly

it theres great weather and um uh amusement parks a lot of scenery a lot of people uh a lot of energy and excitement theres so many things to really like about la see uh a lot of congestion and pollution i i try to but no i dont uh its nice to be on the open road with uh mm potentially potelingly  time to think about my own life shy sometimes i find it hard to express my own thoughts well you mentioned a fish tank and uh i view spent some time in a many waiting rooms where theres been fishtanks and uh uh so staring at fishtanks could be one of them uh but i also enjoy walking or uh lifting weights reading going to movies just to say a few things uh good moderate uh good um in control argued about today okay last argument was today just before i got here and it was about um having about how do i say this about taking them to a bus stop about uh how uh making an arrangement feel guilty about not taking better care of my pet sure i i like birds so one of my pets was a bird uh as of recently and i let my bird out into the wild and sort of wish i had planned for better um future for the for the bird uh only because now i sort of wish the bird was uh closer to me hm i would say i get into arguments with people close to me friends and sometimes i i dont handle them well i am more reactive so i wish uh id like to see myself improve on that uh no um at least not you know in any sort of legal trouble but uh i think its you know its kind of not the way that i would like to have handled it guess the hardest decision was about to of how to proceed with moving forward eh on a job opportunity i had to decide whether if i would suffer more emotional pain by leaving my family and whether the financial gain and uh knowledge of that experience would over outweigh the benefit uh yes yes i am well i its a small family but um have a mother and a uh sister and a brother and uh two younger nieces older theyre theyre grown adults uh its a its a good relationship and uh things could be better um sometimes its sort of difficult pain staking uh relationship at times theres uh some days im i need time for myself and i would rather give the time to other people rather than to take time for myself which has been my experience uh and so that has caused me a lot me a lot of emotional pain uh a little bit of spiritual uh anxiety about my future if i continue to do that sort of thing wow theres so many things laughter what about you i dont know anything about you i would say uh well theres theres a few um but of recent i um well things are going pretty good im cant really say theres anything as of yet that i would really want to change or or have anything to regret on that i can remember its been pretty good and uh its uh id say its okay uh im handling my sleep pretty well when i dont sleep well sometimes i can be irritable um sometimes its okay uh and uh would say if theres also times where im unhappy so i try to get as much sleep as i need yes i believe i was uh nineteen and uh im glad i did it yes uh sort of but uh yes no um well uh i guess i suppose it made me a more confident person and more um in tune with uh uh the country that im living in and people uh to be more noticeable more watchful of where i live um hanging out with some friends uh on a really nice weekend and uh on a boat uh or on a skiff a really small boat and um trying to fish in i felt uh free or alive um happy um uninhibited uh strong confident uh mature after the military uh after military took some time to evaluate my my thoughts and uh my future and um just sort of took uh the necessary steps uh to move ahead uh its sort of hard it is um uh it wasnt easy uh a lot of family uh help and um and community and uh so it took some adjusting but it wasnt easy uh no no

museum or uh stare at some art or uh maybe something in the local community maybe street art and uh or perhaps something with music or uh something something of that nature i wish perhaps uh some things that i could change about myself um make more decisive about decisions and uh something else um that i had the same ability for a knack for uh for meeting more people i suppose as best friends describe me i dont know um nice friendly uh trustworthy sociable uh the same advice id give myself laughter today something wow uh i really enjoy spending time with my girlfriend and her two children

sync hello  yes  okay not too bad im from chicago south side um back in nineteen seventy eight when i was eighteen yes y lately not much maybe once every two or three years um its totally different you know horrible weather and uh yeah its just a whole different atmosphere um lets see my mother had moved to africa i graduated from high school and i had a friend out here so i just thought well let me try la uh very easy actually yeah i loved it from the moment i got off the airplane yeah number one the weather um sun is very important to me so i love the weather um i dont know just kind of a more laid back atmosphere variety of people and now its my um my home base you know my friends that are family so its kinda like my family is here now hmm i guess the smog earthquakes um traffic just basic things like that really um i dont currently but i did throughout my life i traveled quite a lot uh just seeing seeing other cultures and seeing um more history and meeting  people and just fun and the the fun of it as well um lets see well one trip i went to england ireland and scotland and france all in you know one trip so that was a nice variety um i guess you could say probably skiing in val disere france that was fun im glad i got to do that im kind of shy by nature ive tried to grow out of being shy so im not fully shy but i was always a an extremely shy child but now here in culver city this is my environment and i i guess you could say im not really shy in in my hometown of culver city hm to relax i like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap watch tv sometimes on the couch in the living room just you know stay at home and kinda vegetate uh pretty good yeah my tempers pretty level hm probably with my husband and i cant remember at the moment what it was about um well when you say my family do you mean my  family from childhood or my current family okay well i guess my current family comes to mind i i have two daughters and my relationships pretty good its okay with them but theyre teenagers which uh you know going theyre going through a lot of hormones and um they can be kinda bitchy laughter and and um but i have hoped that you know theyll grow out of that and soon someday well have a really good relationship um and then theres the husband which i i guess i could say soon to be ex husband hopefully soon  laughter we need to get a divorce but were still together due to financial reasons and yeah yeah so that thats not good the the relationship with the husband but um but since we have determined that we need to divorce our our we dont expect anything out out of each other so we dont argue as much so thats good hm well i guess our marriage i wish i had noticed early on that you know it was like way off from what i thought it was um sigh lets see oh my god hardest decision i guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard um well you know we were married and i wasnt content i guess you could say um and i kinda just gave up on our relationship and i i now that i look back i think its because i wanted children and he wouldve been happy to never have any and so uh since i didnt have a father it was very important that i create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so i was kind of at a age where i needed to start thinking about having children yet i was with someone who really was not into it so that i think thats one uh maybe the core reason why i was not content and i just felt like tisk this marriage isnt gonna work and so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not wanna break up and tisk um tisk and i had to leave him because i just wasnt happy and that was that was very  hard cause you know i felt like i was hurting him  which which i was you know and he survived he got over it now hes  married with two kids laughter laughter but um it was hard to leave him mm something i wish i could erase from my memory i have to think about that im sure theres something gasp oh well yeah theres um i guess itd be nice to erase from my memory  um a recent i mean not recent but an event in my recent adulthood here in culver city where one of my best friends um ive betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really needed  a larger home and um we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent both to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home tisk and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and uh yeah that was devastating i dont think i had ever  been betrayed like that so i wish i could  erase that now cause now you know this was back when the kids were really young and um my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was lets say six maybe um maybe five anyway her h her and my best friends daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and um they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school  so they didnt get to hang out during those years but every time wed run into them in the neighborhood or theyd run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even though its her their moms werent talking to each other anymore so now theyre thirteen and fourteen and theyre in middle school together and theyre still very connected in fact laughter she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and its just a little awkward you know cause now these girls are becoming really good friends better friends um and yet i still have this vivid um bad memory of what her her mom did to to me that was about what ten about eight years ago anyway sigh i tried to i tried to ignore it and put it out of my head and which ive been able to sniff in recent years but obviously it still comes up anyway that that was that sniff um not that easy i do sometimes get a decent nights sleep but sometimes its hard to get to sleep and most of the time i wake up and cant get back to sleep uh or i finally get back to sleep and then its almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom laughter and then um tisk you know its not always that easy to get back to sleep and then i wake up again to go to the bathroom so i guess thats the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there i dont know i think theres just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day i feel like i havent accomplished enough during the day so its hard for me to just go to sleep when im supposed to i guess um well im kinda used to it now so i just go on through the day probably looking laughter looking tired and um i im kinda used to feeling tired i just do what i need to do and sometimes if im able to if im at home and dont have huge commitments yeah i might just like i said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch tv watch whatever lately how have i been feeling um kind of down on myself down on life well i have this pending need n need for separation slash divorce um tisk i worry that i made a lot of mistakes with my girls now theyre teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood clears throat and so i worry that you know i did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance and their early childhood and  clears throat now its too late um like i missed out on a thing th a lot of things uh and yeah i need a job im unemployed i dont know what i wanna do with my life i know i wanna do something i i i just wish you know i never did finish college unfortunately because i was traveling and stuff so i i regret that extremely and i need to get a job and be able to take care of myself cause i need to divorce and move on with my life so now i forget what the original question was but  laughter um thats the state part of the state of my life no yes mm tisk well the first time or or or recently the first time i guess was you know when i was in my early twenties i was just a little upset about laughter coincidentally that was another breakup i had to make back then i was um tisk in my early twenties and i needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting cause i you know it was hard because he didnt wanna break up and i felt like i was hurting him and i didnt understand this feeling i was really upset how i didnt that was my first time having depression so i didnt really recognize r recognize it as depression but i went somehow i had the knowledge or the i was able to take myself to a psychiatrist i remember i paid for her by the hour and she prescribed xanax to just help relax me and so i guess that helped me get through that and then ive had depression throughout the years just you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as i guess its usually a relationship laughter you know um yeah so the most recent time i was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about two years ago no um money i i dont have insurance otherwise yeah id be happy to go to therapy laughter anything that might help ooh laughter boy last time i felt really happy um i dont know i guess maybe when my children were born thats laughter um i guess happy i dont know laughter i just you know i always wanted children so it was nice to have them thats i dont know thats all i can remember of that i dont i guess i dont remember the good times too well laughter i remember the bad times sniff mm something i did that i really enjoyed well lets see i um friday night i went to a friends house and met up with five other girlfriends and we we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun yeah we get to ooh sigh stay in college get my degree um get therapy try to become a happy um yeah try to figure out things earlier in life like yeah stay in college and oh and mainly i think the main you know what it all boils down to laughter no matter what youre depressed about it seems like as as the saying goes and the songs s the songs go you know its all about money the world revolves around money and having none that in itself is very depressing laughter so besides relationships and different things  that have happened in your life having no money is you know its like you cant even try to fix anything because you dont have the money to fix it so with that in mind i would uh definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to stick s get a job and stick with it um dont quit to go traveling you know just stick with a job stick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field yeah that wouldve been my biggest piece of advice to myself not much laughter i guess just my daughters you know theyre beautiful daughters and im proud and glad that i was able to have children some people arent even able to do that you know and they  try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so thats the one thing i mean i wanted five children and i always wanted a boy which i never had but um im i guess thats the biggest thing i can think of to be proud of is having my two daughters um im a very loyal friend and person thats why when that friend betrayed me it was so devastating yeah very loyal um very inhale happy hap i mean huh what was i gonna say i was gonna say happy lucky l go lucky i dont know where that came from im very i meant to say friendly and caring and um yeah i care about people and im interested in people and i care about animals as well actually thats another thing im proud of proud of being a vegetarian yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian im a vegetarian because i really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals too and you know i dont think that animals should be  tortured and live a a tortuous life just so we can eat em so um what was the question do you remember the question okay youre welcome bye

sync yes clears throat im actually feel f i feel pretty good cause i uh i slept all day yesterday almost and i usually im doing something if its not work its school if its not school its work and then social life and all that so um i actually didnt have work yesterday and i dont have school i only have school on the weekdays so i actually slept probably like eighty five percent of the day so i actually feel kinda good but im actually kinda tired as well and i have other stuff going on but other than that im good today im originally from bakersfield california really uh i moved to la when i was an infant and then i left here when i was around three or four and ive been move i moved back here in oh seven and ive been living here um ever since um wow since ive been here since oh seven ive only been back maybe clears thoat maybe like a couple times ti well i went there for like a summer like in oh eight i think i was there for like almost the whole summer but ive only been back a couple times um since ive been back here unfortunately uh sigh uh laughter uh it compares to la um it doesnt really compare to la i i grew up in sacramento actually i didnt get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here and then i anyways i dont know if i did i forgot anyways um yeah theres like nothing really to do there its really small its the valley um la has all the stuff to do it has um oceans and its by all kinds of um located um by a lot of um cool places like vegas and uh san diego and what have you not so s um but yeah other than that i miss my friends and stuff but i dont miss like the actual city i just miss uh some of the people that i grew up with oh i cant see your shoes but um i dont travel a lot actually ive only been out of california like six times so i would like to travel once i uh have enough money to do so um well originally i wanted to be a filmmaker and which i still wanna be a filmmaker and i um studying stu i was took i took communications and uh did general ed stuff too and um took like video production classes and um tisk lip smacking did a lot of stuff uh in regards to um filmmaking and i have learned a lot of stuff and i still have that knowledge however i havent really used it since ive been back here in la i did all that stuff in northern california in sacramento but um and then i transferred trans um switched over to be uh to business which i took some classes in that but now im actually studying to be an optician and im actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get in the field and become an optician so but i do wanna be uh i actually still wanna be a filmmaker and um thats still one of my plans and i still actually i got into um playing poker a few years ago and i really like the idea of becoming a full time filmmaker or full time poker player however both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of and you have to be like the small percent so well see if not then hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere to be an optician oh um uh i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like its like a trade its well its a private college but it just like specifically trains you into um one field and you just learn that you dont do like your ge and all these other classes like you normally would do for like um like a um a major or whatever youre gonna do so it just trains you specifically to be an optician and jump in the field i um took it just because i actually want w want to be a dental assistant and since si it sound like something maybe i could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually um got my attention to be an optician so im now trying to be an optician and its interesting so its fun its um really hard but its interesting and it and it um and its its fun it has um rewarding um rewarding benefits as far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel more comfortable with cool uh im definitely outgoing however i can be shy sometimes like im kinda shy right now because talking to you and youre uh in a computer and youre a cartoon or uh animated or whatever laughter so cool but no usually ninety eight percent laughter um i actually which it is actually kinda funny and i think maybe this might go for some of the poker players too um i dont really ive never really talked to any professional poker player but as far as like um i actually playing poker is um actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like um stuff in the past or present um or future stuff thats coming up uh as far as like i am really relaxed rela i really um could just not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually its kinda like a therapy thing for me cause i dont like i guess you could say its a kinda drug because um i dont think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed or stuff thats happened in the past i just like focus on poker so its actually kinda relieving however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess its kind of like um catch twenty two or whatever but uh yeah so no poker i play like to play basketball i like to watch movies i like to go to the beach actually one of the things i like to do is go to the beach cause it does um it makes me feel good but it i didnt go i usually only go to the beach when its hot not during the cold season so its coming up soon so im looking forward to that im gonna be busy but uh ill try to go out to the beach as much as i can laughter um im really good at controlling my temper actually ive only been in like im thirty years old ive been in like six fights maybe and all six of em were started by the other person so ive never started a real fight in my whole life like i started fights when i was a little kid but talking about like real stuff like once you get passed it at like thirteen fourteen sniffle uh but yeah no im good like every now and then like theres been a couple times maybe in the past where like i wasnt able to control it but um as far as like ever being violent or anything thats never occured and never would but for um majority of the time yeah i dont have like people do stupid things all the time and i just like let it go especially like um on the freeway and stuff but uh oh well i mean i argued a bit with my ex girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really um petty things i guess that maybe we just i think we were good for each other but uh maybe some other lifetime because uh we just bumped heads too much so obviously shes my ex girlfriend probably for a reason so we just argued about girlfriend boyfriend things uh um i guess my filmmaking filmm um handled differently theres a lot of stuff i couldve handled differently but uh uh maybe like when i was doing really good when i was younger and i was um working for scrubbedentry production assistant for filmmakers around um where i lived in sacramento so i was doing everything that i wanted to do as far as my dreams are concerned and had a lot all my stuff together i had my own car my own apartment and then i got involved with like uh the wrong group of people i guess and kinda tumbled downhill from there and like lost everything like car job apartment so i just wish that maybe i never got involved with those kind of people that kinda of girl um uh ever uh because clears throat i woulda probably it probably my life probably would be a lot different now however i believe that everything happens for a reason and obviously i think you should also like if stuff happens good or bad uh sigh uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again you could um not make that mistake or try not to make it as bad i guess so you know mm hardest decision i guess i guess uh hardest decision the hardest decision i have ever had to make would be um i guess you could say uh i dont really know was gonna say that uh maybe like my ex girlfriend like i couldve like stayed with her and i really like still am in love with her and uh would like to be with her and miss her but i guess the biggest mistake mis um decision that i had to make was like i know that it wasnt like a healthy relationship and i know if we like stayed together or if we got married or had kids that i dont think it would end up working out anyways so i guess the decision my hardest decision would be to like actually stay away from her and not get back with her and uh be uh not with her so i guess that was a hard really hard decision because um i could easily have done it and i guess maybe i wouldve been happier in that way but stressed out and um irritable or whatever and the other way of having to deal with her i guess deal with each other our our relationship so it was really hard still is so uh i guess thats it not choosing to be with someone that i i loved and loved me or whatever so cool oh what was that i beg your pardon nevad i dont understand the first part of that question oh an event oh an event okay um that i could erase sigh uh event that i could from my memory uh my ex girlfriend i wish id never met her my first girlfriend and my last girlfriend i wish i never met them cause uh we w we were together in love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard so i guess both of them oh its extremely easy i could fall asleep anywhere i actually the other day i broke a record i almost fell asleep standing up which wouldve been weird because i guess i wouldve fallen down or something i dont know i just caught myself i guess i was really r i mean i was really tired but i i do a lot of stuff so its hard for i dont really get that much sleep as much as i would like l like but i could sleep when im dead or whatever so as they say tisk uh no no uh lately im just tired but im alright i guess im dealing with this breakup still its only been like a month an a week but its actually its not i mean ive had worse things happen i mean worse things happen had worse things happen so yeah i guess sigh well im a religious person im catholic i believe in god i know theres a god so um i obviously even all of it even devoted people to god um regardless of what they are they uh sometimes lose faith so i do lose faith sometimes but it doesnt really last for that long and i know that there is a god i know that ill be okay and that everything will be okay but you know its hard um deal with them i i dont really i just keep going you know go to school and work and i just have to keep going i cant give up so i just try to stay busy and staying busy helps kind of and like sleeping a lot helps but i dont get to sleep a lot so um i dont know uh playing poker playing basketball deals helps me deal with it and like uh hanging out with my friends helps me sometimes why uh uh uh i felt really happy on friday because um i went to san diego for the first time and uh i didnt it wasnt as cool as i thought it was gonna be but uh we were like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so i wouldve much rather been free during that time but i wasnt but we had fun and it was cool uh i enjoyed it so yeah i really liked uh i was had fun and i was happy about going to san diego for the first time and i um had a good time oh shes sigh um laughter a lot of things but i guess i would say like be nicer to like um family members you know a couple family members that i wish i wouldve been different to um acted different to not that i was like a horrible but i couldve been nicer in some instances that if i didnt know the situation at hand uh i wouldve never like really um went out and partied all the time like i did like high school and different part times of out of high school i wouldve just really focused on um schooling and stuff and then did the partying later uh wouldnt have gotten relationships that um so i wouldve just told myself more basically to be more uh have more direction be more focused i guess uh stay away from people and unhealthy relationships unhealthy people i guess not that im the healthiest but sniffle um yeah i just wouldve done a lot of stuff different but i um i dont know if i said this earlier but i believe everything happens for a reason um so i guess everythings happening now for a reason so im just gonna keep going laughter uh tisk i guess they would the few that i do have or few that i used to have cause i have best friends now a couple i guess one new one and ive lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like went out own ways but i guess they would all probably describe me more as like um happy ha energetic uh funny crazy uh loud uh silly uh smart and uh i just in i guess in uh in general just like entertaining to be around have i havent always a always been the best bestest best friend but i try you know my hardest so thats it like cool um sigh change myself uh tisk i wish i was um xxx i wish i was like fifteen pounds lighter um i wish i didnt need uh how do i say put this uh i feel like um i feel like im a i feel like i i need to be like in a relationship with a girl i feel like i wish i didnt have to be like feel like that i needed to have a girl all the time and so i could that could help me like focus more and i wish that like i didnt need sexual um i wasnt always thinking about sexual stuff towards girls all the time as far as like me having to be in a sexual thing with them like as far as like wanting sex as much as i do cause i feel like if i didnt concentrate or have to do like get be with girls or in a relationship to like well who i dont know how to say it but im just saying like i theres like guy friends that i know that dont need sex as much as i do and i feel like i need it more than i feel like sometimes that i wish i didnt need n need it as much so maybe i guess im addicted to it a little bit where like i i could focus on more things other than just i mean i dont just focus on sex but i just feel like if focus on if i didnt want it need it or think i need it as much that i could get more stuff done in my life but yeah so im trying im working on that deep breath sigh what am i most proud of uh im most proud of makes sounds with mouth the the im most proud prou oh i guess i guess im most proud of working for um television station back in sacramento and working on a lot of um film sets cause like i i was sixteen and i decided i wanted to be a fimmaker and then two years later a year and a half later basically i got i started making steps to become a filmmaker and then i ended up working wor working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really really um really um good um cinematographer a really good um freelance cinematographer that was based that lives in sacramento they did a lot of things so im proud that had a dream and i went for it and i and actually ended up doing stuff to go towards my dream that were in my dream so um yeah i guess thats one of my biggest accomplishments which was like over ten years ago but i you know hopefully something like that could happen again soon

sync okay mm okay sure mm doing okay im from uh la yeah i like the weather i like the sports teams i like the entertainment yeah uh its pretty much the same year round as far as well actually the weather could be good and could be bad you dont get to get all four seasons so its its kinda like a mixed bag and um i guess i maybe im kinda used to it by now so itd be kinda nice to explore other areas ive lived here all my life having done too much traveling so uh its a little bit of uh kind of a ruttiness to it but uh overall its okay uh well i took computer programming in operations but thats going back to the seventies so its technologys changed a lot as you can tell laughter in the last forty odd years laughter thats why thats my that was my major yeah um i dont know its kind of its kind of inquisitive you have to use your mind uh it was like you know brand new something you know very novel back in the in the old days you know back in the seventies now its everything to computers but back then it was sort of like sniff something very unique um you didnt see you know too many computers around back then and um i worked in programming so i was kind of into the logicalness of it you know putting together you know solving a a particular um problem you know come up with step by step solutions on i guess all sort of back then i was kind of more into the the analytic ana analytical ana analytical ana analyticalanal i cant say that word now laughter the analyticalness of the um the problem mhm uh no i kinda phased out i still use computers but i havent gotten i been havent been in programming for a long time um well i kinda got into a another area kinda diversion di uh diversion divorcion to diversion to another area in my life uh this is going back to the um the late seventies i kinda took another turn and then by the time i kinda got back into it it was i kinda got into another field so i never really pursued it to the degree that i wanted to wow thats a good question laughter i never thought about that uh well actually kinda ki ironically i ironically actually something was pretty simple at this point in time this is why maybe im kinda like made me a little bit depressed and then i um at this point i kind of just wanted kind of just do a nice relaxing job but but i do want somewhat of a challenge but i dont want to have to like do too much too much thinking thats almost like the opposite of what i was back in the in the old days you know i just want a nice comfortable relaxing job that i i can feel fulfillment on but i dont wanna too tense of a situation im kinda at the point in my life where i just want a nice relaxing job yeah laughter yeah oh i would say well for the most part shy but sometimes once i get going i could be outgoing um but i generally speaking im im shy to begin with and then i at times i can kinda loosen up and be more vocal and sometimes i can take it to the to the extreme where im talking too much like once the funny gates open up they kind of laughter open up too much so i have to like back off you know but overall i would say im kind of shy as as a general demeanor oh really laughter laughter yeah laughter oh um well i listen to music um ill um well i watch tv um ill um just what what do i do to relax well i just try uh avoid stressful situations so like kinda i stay relaxed i also talk to my friends too ill be around an area around kind of a comfort area where i i feel safe i can just dialogue with people so kinda gets me out of my thinking about my own problems im having i kinda just you know focus on being in the moment with my um acquaintances acqu friends and acquaintances um im pretty good i dont really have a temper problem it takes a lot to get me to uh to explode i think when i was w in my younger days i think i was a little bit more had a little bit slight bit of temper i never had a really bad temper but uh uh temper is not really an issue i have i i tend to be pretty mellow easy going yeah wow thats a good question um im not sure to be honest um id have to think about that for a long time laughter to be honest i i cant come up with an answer on that its not really part of my repertoire um nothing comes to mind off top of my head well um well the only thing i can think of and kinda going way back i made some bad investments in bad investments back about ten years ago i was more um im trying to think of what word im looking for more trusting of people like uh people and like uh tisk who i thought were expert in their field and um i uh i inherited some money i was a little bit careless with it and i just kinda had a vibe you know that uh nothing would go wrong kinda a little bit of naitivity nait naitivity and um unfortunately i made some bad financial decisions it kinda put me in a bad position for the rest of my life unfortunately um because of a medical conditions i have its hard for me to rebound and you know make it all up so i would say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions that i really regret wow hmm thats a tough one i cant think of anything off the top of my head laughter okay oh well uh dont really have too much family left the only one i have is my um its just me and my uncle and we communicate c we communicate on a regular basis um he lives li but he lives in clearwater florida so uh were were okay but um uh hes like eight hes hes in his eighties and obviously im in my fifties so um we we do we have kinda a small talk hes kinda concerned about my well being but its kind of on somewhat of a shallow sh on a shallow level its not we dont get really deep and uh hes got his own problems so we dont really get into too deep of a conversation and other than him its really theres not really anybody else i have so it did it probably makes me a little bit depressed cause i dont really feel i have anybody i can really count on or really confide in um it is challenging uh i dont know why but i do have a medical condition so i think that might be part of the problem and um i have a little bit of bpa so ocassionally ill get up have to go to the restroom and um so to to answer your question laughter to make a long story short laughter um it is challenging to get a good nights sleep i usually uh wake w wake up feeling a little bit tired or achy so it is it is difficult uh sigh well ive been feeling okay i mean um ive been kinda feeling mellow actually um im im trying to address issues that i havent taken uh responsibility for but um i feel a bit of calmness as of late no well i did say yes when i filled out the questionnaire and um im not positive if i was technically diagnosed with it i did take a uh i think its called mmph the minnesota multifaceted personality something of whether this is going back about six months ago they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got into questions about my my well being psychologically too and i think some of the the answers said that they advise that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist i didnt follow that up on that because of philosophical differences but uh i think i might have a you know a mild case of depression well you know um like i said im just kinda like kinda going along in life im uh im doing okay but i you know i kinda lifes passing me by so i havent really fulfilled my my goals i you know im kinda like alone id like to have a girlfriend i dont have a girlfriend so thats kind of somebody who i feel i can get close to and im not really im kinda in a transitional period in my life right now so uh theres a little bit of uncertainty i have some you know kinda financial uncertainties so um you know overall im not doing as good as id like to wow thats a good one laughter really happy um let me think about that a minute well actually um it wasnt that long ago actually i went to um makes sound with mouth okay i know that one actually i can come up with an answer um i helped out a lady she was at a at a tradeshow it was anaheim it was a natural products expo so it was pretty nice we uh we had some nice meals afterwards there was a lot of exhibiters giving out really nice samples it was in anaheim so i kinda got a chance to get away from la and um you know met some interesting people uh they were very outgoing they were willing to like have me experience their product or service and um i was around people that i work with who uh i got to socialize with so uh i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh about a month ago yeah yeah it was best friend i dont know if i really have a best friend but uh i would say um hmm i dont know technically i really dont have a best friend so its really hard for me to answer that so uh i cant really come with an answer to be honest laughter um i i like to be conscientious i you know i do have flaws and every but i think overall im conscientious i try to be honest for the most part on the on the major issues i might you know say little white lies or you know im not perfect on that but when it comes to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest and im im a hard worker i got g got good work ethic um i tend to be pretty calm for the most part um what do i regret well can you elaborate that laughter uh well um i just well just overall um i regret uh not being a little more assertive in in my earlier uh earlier life um and kinda put myself in this position its going kinda goes back to my financial decisions that was sort of thats sort of like my albatross in my life i made some bad decisions and unfortunately i have to kinda pay the price for now so i kind of like sort of like living sort of a pauper existence right now which is kinda kinda depressing so i would say thats probably what i regret most of all well id say to really you know analyze kinda go with what you really feel um i think i was going with other peoples opinion other peoples advice i was kinda going away from my basic beingness you know like the way i really felt like for example id make i would do aggressive uh investing which if it turned out good it wouldve been like sort of like winning the lotto i wouldve been well off for the rest of my life laughter but unfortunately it went the opposite way too too many eggs in that basket so i kinda regretted going with my gut feeling and and let other people influence me and uh cause by nature im a conservative person so i should really do more concervative investments in other areas my life i tend to be more conservative but i kinda made some aggressive financial f financial decisions so thats pretty much kinda it always goes back to that area as far as what i regret yeah wow thats interesting uh well ive been doing a lot on weekends so laughter laughter well i do like like to be profitable uh i like to do something where i can actually you know make money thats sort of like my bread and butter time cause i do tradeshows but if im not doing that then i like to maybe watch some um you know id like to go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game uh go to a movie go out with some friends so i would just or you know just kinda kick back but my main primary prima primary focus would be on you know earning earning money on the weekends uh thats interesting most proud of um i would say that i lived by and large i lived a wholesome life i would say i never got myself into any kind of really bad bad uh vice um you know i i lived a pretty wholesome wholeso wholesome life id say thatd probably i dont know if its really proud um but as but as far as i stayed the course as far as uh not going down any real deep laughter alleys so to speak okay my pleasure bye now          
sync yes uh im fine today today is my daughters birthday california yes um the beach i love the waters the gang violence violence um i lost a lot of friends growing up in um through elementary and high school just losing them through gang violence yeah thank you it was pretty tough out there laughter um havent been to any place out of california yet so not really um im an optician im a certified optician and i also have my associates degree um actually i went in i didnt really know what i wanted to do when i first applied i just knew i wanted to change my life and do something successful um before i settled down and you know had my daughter and everything um actually my guidance counselor kind of helped me and i i always thought like they were so cool cause their white long lab coats to be a optometrist um cause im already an optician and thats like the first step and um what i why is a good question its because then i would have a be able to have my own business and i would have something successful to leave to my daughter and she wouldnt have to really want to anything it would be like a a family business but a a to help the community as well and something i could leave for my daughter uh my daughter shes five years old uh shell be starting elementary school next week and today is her birthday uh five years ago i had her laughter um she is very smart um i taught her home i home schooled her for five years and um shes adorable shes my heart no this is like the hardest job ever laughter its very hard providing providing uh making sure that you wash their clothes um cause cause i mean its hard enough to be um a parent but im a young parent and im a little more mature than her father so its um its its the providing part i would basically say making sure that you have everything that they need its so complicated let alone um it gives you enthusiasm to be more to go the extra mile um even being here today i probably wouldve still been in bed but today is my daughters party and i was trying to make whatever extra little money i could make you know to make sure that she has a good day so its all about uh going the extra mile doing anything that you can do to provide pro to provide for them but it its a very hard job um that moment of the day when your child tells you how much they care about you and um my daughter her favorite thing is to tell me im her im her heart you know and and how many i mean just call your name it just its a sense of reality um to be called mom or to call call dad and it it just like it infatuates you it also let you know like this is reality this is this is my life this is what im living right now and its a its a very good feeling thats the best part of being a parent thank you um a lot of different things im actually taking care of my daughter laughter um im here with her uh i was raised by my grandparents so i mean i didnt really i didnt get to know my mom til i was sixteen and my father i mean i couldnt point him out on the street on the sidewalk so i dont know who he is so i feel that um im very different from them because no matter how hard the job is getting i dont give up yeah um i guess i theres been yawning oh excuse me um theres been a lot of different people that have been very positive in my life i can say um my sister she was a good influence on me to get into the medical field shes in the uh shes an lva and um shes one of my older sisters um i can say me believing in god being in my life god being in my life has also kept my strong and to know that i dont have to take on this world by myself because god is there for me and um hm i dont know i dont really look up to a lot of different people because people lie so and thats the most what i could think thats been positive for me i think im outgoing laughter i used to be shy um coming up as a kid and i dont know i dont know what happened to me uh one day i just broke out of my shell and ive been um very accurate of showing my personality off laughter um i actually like for the waves to collapse against the rocks at the beach and i like to just sit there and just zone out everybody else thats there and rub my toes in the sand and that is so relaxing um yawning excuse me sorry about that um i learned not to uh cause its a form of its a form of knowing whos in control and is it your life or someone elses and i feel that my temper me controlling my temper is showing that im in charge of my life so i dont even let stuff get to me i dont even really remember the last time that i had to control my temper because thats how much i try to block out the  the negativity mm probably my husband yawning my daughters father um uh probably over like uh you know the dishes or like the small things but not uh physical altercation like with another human being no wow um being honest i kind of feel guilty about how things like uh basically how things ended um before my mom passed i wish that i couldve helped her a little more even though people tell me not to feel bad um because she wasnt really there for me growing up but i kind of feel guilty like you know not being there as much as i couldve been for her before she passed away so i think thats something that i um i still feel guilty for um going through my mom passing away um i felt like clearing throat i felt like um basically that it was i felt kind of robbed in a sense like i felt everyone else had parents and i grew up with my grandparents and then for me to go so many years without actual you know mom and dad for me to get eighteen years old and then then she leaves me it was kind of like um i dont know it was nerve wracking because i felt robbed you know it was like i didnt have her all these years and then now that im older and im i dont even have her now so um signing the paper of having a c section when it was time for me to have my daughter i was so nervous so scared um really didnt know what to do how to take it and i mean like that was so scary um it was the safest way of bringing my daughter into this world yes its hard laughter i didnt even sleep last night thats why im yawning yarning but um uh i i kind of tend to try to do everything and i have to get back to that stage where i have to think about myself as well and give myself time um a little like this but actually im a little nicer today laughter um just groggy um yawning lately ive been feeling very confident about um being positive about going the extra mile of being a good parent uh yawning yeah i actually really dont care what other people think anymore i used to let that bother me but i dont no more no no um uh today cause i was so happy that i brought brung my daughter into this world today on her birthday um getting to know people mhm mm not at the moment if i go uh to watch who i associate with my weight laughter uh i would say my grandma mm um uh uh its its just uh id rather not um my daughter thats my pride and joy wow thank you bye
sync sure pretty good new york uh i moved to la in the seventies but i yeah but i lived a lot of different places of um i guess every few years but i travel a lot so ive lived in ive lived in africa ive lived in spain switzerland hong kong too um different cultures food music rituals uh everything the smells the colors makes you feel alive excuse me one of my trips uh i lived in kenya for about a year um id say i love horseback riding so when youre uh viewing other animals when youre kind of disguised in the scent of a horse you can approach the animals a lot closer so um it was great seeing red orange fall sunsets and riding along you know uh seeing so many animals yeah in kenya um probably when i went to a a masai village and i happened to i used to live in hawaii and ive had been to tahiti and i was wearing one of those pareos that are hand painted and i had it tied over the left shoulder with the twisted in a knot and i happened to enter a masai village for the first time uh that day and i looked all around and the men were wearing their clothing exactly with the same twist laughter on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed masai and uh laughter and um then they came back and gave me what appeared to be uh some very large what looked like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings so they wouldve like weighed my ears straight down and um and then then they gave me some bracelets and then they had uh me wear something around my waist and they said now you look proper masai laughter so but i i yeah i just i have a lot of uh i think living getting a chance to live in different countries around the world ive just uh you feel alive all your senses are completely you know uh awoken yeah sigh i think its not so clear cut i think a lot of peoples are a hybrid of both i mean i think i can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely brazen uh and very courageous at other times probably one of my best virtues is im very gutsy person so when i really feel passionate about something i risk everything to go achieve it sometimes um i believe that um usually i well i make decisions very quickly and i find that i have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how i can make decisions quicker and i told him i said well in each case you always have no choice and he says what do you mean theres hundreds of choices and i said not really because its gut wise is only one and it doesnt really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice what you really wanna do is and it doesnt matter whether theres a ninety eight percent chance of failure even if its a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that its its to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another choice cause who cares if you remain unscathed but it when it yields no joy uh pardon you said you put your fish what do i do when im annoyed um sigh tisk i think when im annoyed sometimes i its because sometimes i can have i can need to be a little more patient um i guess you really have to put yourself in somebody elses shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy um not really i think thats the reason why i enjoy traveling so much cause youre put in other situations where youre forced to to um understand other peoples lives a lot more regardless of how different they are uh from yours different situations ive been to so many third world countries and and lived in so many different situations that you y it it helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is sigh let me think um tisk uh sigh last time i argued about something um god im trying to remember laughter um oh i think it was when somebody didnt respect actually my privacy in something um uh sigh oh i know what it was um it was somebody who belonged to the uh uh scientology faith um i uh inherited i inherited um possibly uh a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus and um uh i sometimes even right now i have like skin rashes welts and everything and i am very photo sensitive and um tisk i had an you know an episode where i was i had big flare up and i wasnt really feeling well i felt flushed and everything and the scientologist tells me that i needed to be audited and um and he said something about are you aware of past lives and i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that if youre going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed and to be able to talk to them and i and he said that are you aware that um tisk about something in your past and i go yes i believe that many religions uh including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have ha have had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness um resulting from even your past relationships or your parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and also a we also believe i said that you know that you have the power of each person has a god like or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when im on the verge of possibly being i probably get one cold maybe every fifteen years i dont have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it is i think when i think im on the verge i take sort of like and i did this even when i was a child uh when i was seven i would fold down i had my boo boo and i would take ta i would say i would have the good part you know help the bad part laughter from a simplistic way in terms of a child and i would actually even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back i concentrated healing and and when i went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that just jj her last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but uh um uh but i was just i think annoyed and irritated a little because the scientologist told me that because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it didnt did it wasnt even a matter i said of whether he was um whether he took twenty forty courses or whether id been practicing buddhism whether it was for five ten fifteen twenty years or whether somebodyd been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and bending sitting in a church pew every day it doesnt mean this person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has you know so i just was thinking that was the antithesis of somebody who says theyre enlightened but its just the way i guess he kept cramming his uh you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with him but he it was so pompous that i became irritated especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery uh the following week and i didnt point it out to him cause i just didnt wanna get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip cause you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldnt need to get a hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves and then hes flippantly said well are you aware of scientologists believe that past lives can also affect you know and im thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are are kind of like well known for you know believing in in a cause and effect and past lives situations and i found my thought he should really read up if hes trying to convert other people laughter from other religions so but um tisk you know i i you know i i just didnt you know care for the fact that he wouldnt drop it laughter but other than that i mean i dont sigh um uh sigh sometimes to have a little more tact i guess when when its in terms of patience i can think of that right away i guess uh disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital mm sigh mm my brother uh was supposed to be the strong one supposedly because he is in the medical field so my sister and i said well you know hes the medical one so hes probably used to seeing this all the time but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after you know my boss my father kept you know um um you know bucking the his body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and all kinds of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard mm but you know it was after a while the uh you know even the physicians and even the uh pastor from that particular uh hospital ho you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he his brain function wouldve been b been you know negligible yeah it was mhm hm mm i dont think i really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that ive had to block them i really dont know what it is within my makeup which doesnt make me feel like i need to like i dont keep i have friends that have unmitigated issues which theyre not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger or their hatred or their fear and for some reason i i feel blessed that i dont really i cant really even think of something that i mean ive had some bad situations happen to me but its not that the some reason theyve traumatized me in affecting you know my behavior where i would where i block it that im not aware of something or i hold residual negativity for some reason so i really cant think of anything i mean theres bad things that happen and i know theyre there but its not like i feel like i its necessary for me to block them cause ive been able to you know um accept sometimes so sometimes there were unfortunate things that happened pretty easy i can usually make my sleep i self sleep in any situation if i have a one hour flight to san francisco i could just kind of lean against the window with the pillow have the blanket over and even on an hour flight pass out before the plane has even taken off from the ground so i can just j i have literally when ive had little sleep and i very uh high energy so i dont really need that much sleep but say like if im in africa and i tisk bumpy potholed unpaved road and i suddenly saw that i need a few moments of sleep ill just prop something up put my elbow against the window and say i think ill gonna take a nap for laughter fifteen minutes go like this and through the jostling i coud just take a nap for fifteen minutes so i dont really have ha have that problem okay pretty okay i mean i could deal without the skin flare ups but you know from the photo sensitivity and all that but other than that im in pretty good spirts uh huh have i ever studied s studied what uh i could still couldnt hear you im sorry have i ever studied changes ch changes in my behavior what was the word um no uh uh um sigh i dont know just with friends and everything just even this past week just seeing friends that i enjoy being with and just having a great meal laughing just you know having a good time listening to music regret about my entire life you mean or are you talking about just recently or what are you talking about mm you know its funny uh i find that a lot of the negative experiences that in in my life that have happened have also been uh um opened up experiences that are that are also great that i have not overlooked for example i got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my whole wh my whole savings and ive had to start all over again and sometimes people sat to me like are you sure youre okay are you are you just pretending to be okay or are you angry do you wanna seek revenge if i was you know cause my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each others families which was even more difficult in a way um and uh he stole essentially my whole lifes savings essentially in a way and he was w got sent to prison and the fbi was involved interpol was involved uh i was living in switzerland and my father was sick and i was going back and forth and um tisk uh but you know if i hadnt get involved hadnt ha hadnt gotten involved with him in business i wouldnt have had the a lot of rich experiences and i think sometimes the reason why i dont know why im such a positive person but for some reason uh im able to its not that im purposely trying to i do see the positiveness in even horrible situations i wouldnt have gotten to live in barcelona and zurich i wouldnt have learned to speak as good spanish german g german uh lived in in europe if i had not gotten involved in business with my business partner who ended up ripping me off but and theres a lot of other experiences and different friendships that i developed during that period of time and in a way it was a total different life uh a different world that that would you know that i wouldve never um had the chance you know to live through if i had not involved my you know but of course it cost me financially and but then again ive always been the type of person who you know money isnt everything and i think the when i least cared about money is when i made the most of it so there you go laughter and for example one of my favorite times in my life probably when i lived in kenya and you would think that you know a lot of people have this really bad vision of it maybe looking living in mud dung huts or something and living very primitively i mean it its not like that at all but i and youd think that with the least amount of uh technological tech technological innovations and stuff like that i mean actually and i really didnt have you know that much many m many material goods at the time i mean i had the blast i had probably the one of the best years of my life when i was living in kenya the same thing that i did probably when i was about fifteen or sixteen um to live your life with passion and again like choose the way i was saying earlier about making decisions you have to make those decisions gut wise what will give you a sense of awe and wonderment what would make you give you joy and you have to its its regardless what the percentages are even if you only have a one percent chance of success you have to go towards that cause thats the only thing that will yield you know the happiness in your life tisk the fact that ive adhered to that and been brazen whatever you wanna say have the balls the chutzpah the cojones to go ahead and follow my passions and you know and i guess people call them sometimes strong decisions usually decisions that are easy ea when you where you remain unscathed usually dont yield joy thats just murphys law thats just the way it is sure bye
sync yes okay originally from texas oh few weeks ago uh well ive been living in um palm springs actually so uh la theres a lot more to do and uh weathers a lot better uh for work yes uh the weather the beach a lot of activities things to do mm traffic and the uh rental is higher high a lot higher here uh at at first it was a little difficult but then i adapted uh just in the united states uh new experiences uh learn a lot of things uh yeah one time i went uh yosemite and up through san francisco uh i really enjoy the beautiful scenery uh probably when i uh last year i i uh met a girlfriend up in uh san francisco and drove down highway one and uh saw a lot of uh sights hearst castle things like that uh computer science uh well i went to school back in the eighties and uh computers were uh kind of a new new up and coming thing so decided to to do that little bit not too much uh probably um i think to have like a little uh little magazine uh well ive started already started it its like a small uh local magazine that has uh coupons and uh going to expand it to different uh parts of california probably shy um mm well lets see not uh i guess not as outgoing as many of my friends um actually i uh go dancing i like dancing its relaxing to me uh uh uh i do latin dancing so i do it several times a week so last weekend i went very good um i i think i argued with someone a couple of weeks back it was about a religion religious issue um felt okay mm um see cant think of one right now laughter lets see maybe uh when i was doing one of my real estate sales um i was um sometimes the clients are pretty uh pretty difficult and i think i shouldve been like a little more uh assertive with them mm probably uh moving to california well i was uh leaving my friends and family in texas and um just pretty much starting a new life out in california out here uh well it was it was pretty difficult but you know i got adjusted well um i have only an aunt and a few cousins left so uh its its not too much a relationship i have a a a great a uh an aunt thats the sister of my mom and uh you know i send her texts periodically but uh most of the time i really dont have  much uh contact with family um probably parents both of them were very supportive mm probably when the parents were sick and passed away no uh well i both parents were um uh got sick and uh got dementia and uh its you know one parent didnt remember who i was so it was uh that part was pretty difficult well they they passed away so its just uh its been about ten years so its uh just um its just memories now mm not too easy uh its just tossing and turning i think all night and uh probably thinking thinking too much about things uh probably like the future things like the economy and uh my work things like that uh tired tired laughter mm just uh not as positive no no mm probably uh few weeks ago i received a pretty good uh real estate commission so i was happy about that uh when im in la um going to some of the meet up groups or some some of the uh i like going to whole foods and and trying some new uh places to go salsa dancing no mm probably to be more uh outgoing mm probably be more successful in uh business and be a little more uh uh outgoing mm probably my boss uh hes pretty uh condescending and um really likes to belittle people and uh laughter put him uh put himself as the king so he he has says a lot of comments to make himself build himself up and uh belittle whoever whoever else is in the room uh its well usually when you go in uh he likes to brag on how much money hes made in the business and uh then say things like uh see see how much better i am than you are uh youve look how much money ive made this year and and youre the worst piece of shit agent there is things like that mhm um probably uh i have integrity and a good heart hardworking honest um probably i just went i guess uh some of the times ive gone dancing uh i went to a casino uh in a little town called temecula i met a lot of new friends and uh it uh dancing and meeting friends new friends um probably it was about it uh education i guess my education and uh able to uh move move out here where i wanted to go thank you bye
sync yes im doing okay im from greenwich connecticut yes um i moved here in two thousand eight so about five years ago um i try to go back at least once a year sometimes i go more sometimes less um overall i think i like where im from better than la in general um i think that other than it being somewhere im familiar with the type of people that are there are just more my type and what im used to and its less superficial tisk um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california um initially it was easy because i felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here it became more difficult than originally uh fine arts and photography um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and got awards and things like that and publishments so i decided to pursue art um yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and scrubbedentry yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics um i like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography i feel like its a more secure job and its very interesting um thats a interesting question i guess just my childhood in general growing up um well my familys very close um my extended family as well and they all live li most of them live within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries um i consider myself more shy um i watch reality television i think its kind of funny and lighthearted um i watch like bravo tv like the real housewives shows and just like funny things that you dont really need to pay attention to um im good i guess i dont really have like a temper if im having if im more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i dont really have like anger um well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time laughter just like about like insignificant things but other than that um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago um theres been like some tension going on since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter things about his girlfriend and he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her although he doesnt for whatever reason think that it should go both ways so for like the thirtieth time he we were on the phone and he was sigh telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend cause of the jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesnt want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i i dont care about having a relationship with her so if she doesnt wanna hear from me you know its easier for me um i mean every time t i mean its been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue but the thing is is that he says certain things that are untrue or things he knows that like will tick me off that are really nasty and that he shouldnt be saying to me so he so i kind of just like lose it and i cant really mm like not say anything um well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didnt i only realized that its the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own so it didnt seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now thats probably one of the hardest decisions i made um well i wish i could erase the event or seeing my grandmothers funeral which obviously it wouldnt change anything but it wasnt seeing her there was not something id wanna like have in my memory um she was she was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental um and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean theyre very successful people so whether or not we have like disagreements or that were separate people they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you are older um usually its easy the problem is staying alseep no matter how late i go to bed whether its ten pm or four am i will be up like clockwork by seven thirty or eight oclock in the morning the latest every single day and i cant seem to figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer no i just in the morning i guess im a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now its i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning tisk i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring but it doesnt really im so used to it now it doesnt really change my mood its just part of everyday um i dont know i kind of just feel very mm like so so just no extreme highs no extreme lows its kind of one note land i mean nothing like lately um like recently its just i would say over a period of years ive kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and not very outgoing no no i have been diagnosed with anxiety um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital um cause i thought it was more serious cause i couldnt breathe but they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety i think in the right setting and with the person whos doing it if theyre open minded and the therapist is helpful and good at what theyre doing then yeah no i havent been to therapy since i was a kid um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day it wasnt i didnt feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didnt really get much out of it sigh well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriends house with his family over the new years holiday when im there i can always just we save up our money so its a complete vacation i dont have to worry about paying bills i dont have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out just enjoy the day in general um i regret the college i chose to go to i didnt being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didnt realize until you know the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school like you you cant i didnt even realize you couldnt get a bachelors degree from there when i went so it kind of create created more problems for me sigh well considering im twenty two sigh id probably say ten years ago i would give myself the advice to probably stay closer to home and to have really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california um my best friend would describe me as a great charismatic funny outgoing socially enjoyable person which is different than how people who arent my good friends would describe me which i mean i dont i mean it is what it is i am very outgoing and and have a great time when im with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just i am very shy and dont really speak much um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that yeah um im very caring i im a very good judge of character which i mean i guess i mean i consider it to be a quality qu quality for myself um im very affectionate aff i mean im not very affectionate im more i mean i guess i guess so thanks
sync yeah im okay burbank california yeah the weather of course i think everyone likes the weather um its not too city like chicago or new york its um its big enough we have beaches were not land locked woo sometimes the smog the traffic the fact that ive just been here like my entire life almost not enough as id like to i go to school in chicago and ive been to new york a couple times san francisco and i took a road trip across the country that was cool i saw a couple states seeing new places um going to landmarks that ive only read about or seen pictures of um i traveled from los angeles to chicago taking route sixty six and the best part was seeing the grand canyon for the first time it was the coolest thing ive ever seen probably laughter happy and then just happy it was it was beautiful it was nice i havent felt like that in a long time i was studying film its just something ive always loved for as long as i can remember and when it came time to start applying to schools i wasnt sure what i wanted to do and um i applied to northwestern as a film student and it just ended up being the right decision ooh laughter um i love making movies but part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera so uh comedian a comedic comie laughter comedic actor would be totally great but thats hard laughter i am super outgoing and i love talking to people a lot i like i like being the center of attention usually laughter i um i like to watch mindless television like um toddlers in tiaras and um duck dynasty just tv programs where i really dont have to pay attention at all im okay at it i get really emotional really fast but i am usually able to to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff for the most part sometimes i get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily and i hate apologizing to people so the fights could last pretty long um my best friend laughter ryan i think and it was about our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and uh where how were gonna go back to the way it was before really hard its um hes my best friend and i miss him but we messed up and its just its not the same its like not the same friendship laughter me too laughter laughter too many um i guess scrubbedentry when i had a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend which was not okay i wish i wouldve just realized that this was bad and just wouldve stopped there and not have let it continue for weeks which led to my break up and then our friendship being really messed up i guess not spend as much time with him as i did be more assertive um i guess it was in november i was very depressed and suicidal so i told my friend what i was feeling and that she needed to take me to the er and from the er i had the choice to i dont know i guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital and even though i felt like i didnt have a choice i knew it was my choice and i decided to go to the mental hospital which was like the worst experience of my life ever um exhale it was awful it was in chicago and um it was scary i mean i didnt know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just start giving you medication and youre basically left to your own devices there were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and um they were all really old and it was scary i didnt know anyone everyone most of the people there werent depressed they were violent laughter so that was pretty scary and i just um it was really hard for me laughter i had been so depressed for like a month i stopped going to my classes and work and i told my teachers lies about being sick and i just kept calling in sick to work i dropped a class and i was failing my classes and not turning in any work and i wasnt talking to any of my friends and i was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and i was just in a really bad place and when i finally was gonna kill myself i realized i needed help it was um i had severe depression when i was a younger teenager and i tried to kill myself then and i um got put in therapy for quite some time so i figured i dont want to go down that bad path again i just wanna get better so i had to do it i had to get help i do i go once a week i feel like if you have the right therapist its really useful i had one therapist that i really liked and i thought we couldve gone really far but sadly shes back in chicago and im in los angeles so i have to i have to make do with this new therapist and shes okay shes not were not that great together but shes who i had right now its better than nothing laughter not that easy at all um ever since yawn i got out of the hospital and start and i began medication for my depression i um just havent been able to sleep well falling asleep is hard staying laughter asleep is hard have really crazy vivid dreams that wake me up and are disturbing um i guess just sometimes they reflect things that im worried about or happening in my life but theyre just theyre scary and they seem so real that sometimes i wake up and i have to ask my mom like did we go here did we do this did this really happen and its usually no you dreamed that sometimes ive gotten so scared i like talk in my sleep and wake myself up probably laughter like two nights ago that is a hard question i think in november yawn after i got out of the hospital i finally had one good day and my friend took me into downtown chicago and we went to the sears tower and got to look over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was really cool laughter um probably super outgoing likes to be the center of attention funny and a little bit crazy i try not to regret things in my life oh um i would say that living is worth it and just dont be afraid to ask for help when you need it dont wait until it gets really bad um i guess my ideal weekend would be laughter sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends maybe going home with them and bake some cookies laughter eat all the cookies watch some tv have a sleep over and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies i would like to do that laughter in my free time go for a walk i dont know go to the beach laughter um that is a hard question i mean i think ive done a lot of great things in my life and um i have achieved a lot but i think one of the proudest things proudest moments in my life is something really small and insignificant i was doing this exercise boot camp and the last person to like cross the finish line had to do like thirty push ups and it was some guy i didnt really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone wanna help him if someone helps him you have to do half each and no one wanted to help him and i just decided to start doing push ups with him and i just it wasnt cause i wanted to get credit or because i thought it would make me look good i just did it and no one really knows about that but it just i feel really good about that it was nice it meet you laughter bye
synch yes im good michigan two years ago um every three months its more homey and country than fastpaced and stuff uh the i work in the entertainment business so i had to be out here it was pretty

hawaii last year um i believe we went to hawaii hawa honolulu and to then hmm maui yeah and we met the people in hawaii and they were so nice if i could live there i would um everything was memorable but probably jetskiing in honolulu was very fun yeah outgoing laughter laughter music music is much therapy for me um well my family is very musically inclined like my dad and my moms family so music has always been like that thing no matter how i feel if i put music on it makes it much better im pretty good i used to box so it let out a lot of frustration so sometimes i do that too i go to the gym and i do like a kickboxing class but i dont i never escalated to the point where i like blurt out or no i can control it pretty much well i live with my sisters so i argue every day laughter but it was over clothes my sisters and clothes always clothes um my mother my father are pastors of a church i grew up with two sisters and a older brother who was a cop and were pretty close i have a nephew were pretty close like every day we see each other close and we dont all live in the same house but were together every single day at some point when we lived in a when we lived in michigan my family eh is in michigan um when i cheat like right now im on a diet with my sisters but last night i snuck and got mcdonalds so i feel bad because theyve been so sticking to it and i cheated but thats pretty much laughter it laughter um hmm mm me and my when me and my a friend of mine got into it and we said things that werent like we hit below the belt and we and we usually dont and we havent spoken in like three months now and i know that it couldve been prevented if we wouldve just sat down and talked to each other but it didnt make it that far so yeah um probably moving here moving to la because like im im really like close clo were really close with our family like i skype with my mom and dad every day so it was hard to go from there to here and them taking care of everything to me and my sisters having to do it on our own it was much it was different oh my goodness uh my parents my brother my dad my mom my sisters my family fam i have a great family so my family definitely um i wanna say two years ago three years ago my brother was shot on duty and he almost lost his life but he didnt and for some reason as much as i try i dont tell them this cause i dont want them to be like i need to you know whatever i always think about it over and over again and ill cry about it like it happened yesterday but it happened three years just the mere fact of almost losing him kinda yeah not easy i work as a personal assistant and administrative assistant for a casting agent so im on call for her whenever so im never i never get a good nights sleep ever i know laughter um a zombie laughter im pretty much you would never know cause when its work i im professional so if i am tired theyd never know but im very annoyed and very grouchy when i havent slept um sigh tired and i have crazy headaches but thats probably from not getting enough sleep and working too much but yeah very tired yeah definitely um im shorter with people like being in the industry i mean people dont really care its all about self and when i first came here i had the i had the personality and attitude of family and love and nice and being here showed me that everybodys kinda out for self here even the like the other girls i work with so ive learned to like cut people off and be short with people when thats not really me but i just see thats how you have to be laughter no no um sigh last saturday i did a weighin and i lost seven pounds i was like excited so laughter that was the last time um care too much uh i think about others more than myself so shed probably say i care too much im loving im the person that every friend i have confide in from best friend to just regular friend so yeah im the mom of my friends um no not no i dont regret anything hmm never take no for an answer um i wish i could well i dont know personally i wanna lose like twenty more pounds but uh just i dont know be a little more adventurous little more adventurous um sigh i dont think ive had a time baby feel bad no i cant no i dont think i have one it im sorry i dont think i laughter have one oh um well me and my sisters has just started with yoga and we already do the beach like every friday but yoga is like our new addiction so we do yoga and we probably go to like a spa or something thats an ideal ide yeah um my my job my career because ive gotten a pretty long way at twenty three the job i hold so im pretty pretty proud of that youre welcome bye
sync sure im doing good how are you chicago yeah about twenty five years ago yeah its been a while actually i havent been back laughter i like la i like la mm its a big city so its kinda similar but the weather is not the same so gotta love la for the weather tisk family i was a child it took a little adjustment but not hard um the weather um i cant think of anything right off the bat but i sure wouldnt wanna leave so my family is here so thats another reason why i wouldnt wanna leave traffic laughter not really but ive traveled tra traveled a little bit yeah seeing new places different people the way they live their lives tisk um i went to monterey california earlier last la or the middle of last year that was very nice um its a good question im not really sure uh theres probably i cant think of anything right off the bat which makes me think uh its kinda weird but laughter astronomy yeah it was tisk i dont know just kinda fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and kinda just went down that path no theres not much job opportunities so its kinda limited yeah it does laughter um my dream job i would like to own a restaurant a nice a bar restaurant well id like to have something a little more upscale than most places you go to or at least in the area that i live in most places dont seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of worn out run down so something nice something different something creative something vibrant something for you know attracts a crowd but its probably costly so i dont know if its really plausible laughter im definitely more shy but i can be outgoing when im comfortable with people but initially im pretty shy laughter good idea um a lot of times i try to just lay back and you know do some deep breathing just kind of clear your mind or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book kinda just takes your mind away relax ive gotten much better at it laughter i used to have problems with that when i was younger but im im good im good with that now learned that you shouldnt react immediately to situations you should you know think before you speak that type of thing um my ex girlfriend when we broke up about three months ago laughter um were relationship just wasnt doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and wasnt really it wasnt a memorable argument but it was it was an argument so thats all i can think of and i havent really seen her since so i dont know thats what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who had grown separate frustrated like yeah i guess everybody kinda sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and im sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that you know of your ideas or what youre thinking is more difficult than it is because everybodys kinda looking out for themselves tisk but yeah mm thats a good example right there with the my girlfriend i didnt have to i couldve reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion um theres been times in my life where ive gotten into arguments with friends or something like that where you know or previous relationships where i probably shouldnt have reacted the way i did you know not that i did anything bad but just more of uh you know be more mature about it and not you know reveal your emotions so much or that type of thing tisk um sigh leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was eighteen this was a long time ago i went to school in san diego and i immediately wanted to come back so i kind of ruined our relationship and were still friends and i wish i didnt do that mm i feel like i can contribute more to my family and my friends i i think i could do better i i think i sell myself short so employment opportunities are hard to come by but if i could find a good job id be a lot more happy because i could provide for myself and others so not be so much of a burden to people around me tisk yeah real difficult laughter its good its very good were pretty open with each other and i see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so its a good relationship i mean we we get along well could be i mean its not its not perfect but its good tisk pretty easy im a good sleeper um probably irritable theres its harder to do tasks its kind of like you feel like youre being strange or something because you dont have as much energy and good relatively well spring time always makes everybody feel well no not at all never tisk um really really i mean we all feel happy every day at some point but really happy sigh its probably been a while um probably like superbowl sunday i was with all my friends we were having a good time so its been probably like a month and a half or something when i was really really happy i wish i was more i guess stuck to my goals and i wish i had better drive to succeed i dont know i usually settle for less so i dont know i i guess thats the calm demeanor part of me thats good and bad laughter dont really matter i kinda live in the moment and then you kinda realize that five ten years have gone by and you shouldve done something um im just gonna stick to that argument with my girlfriend laughter three months ago she made me feel pretty bad laughter um i i dont know uh when i was when i was in high school i got into an argument with a friend and i drove my car too fast and it was an area that i didnt know and i hit a turn that i didnt know was coming and i crashed my car so i wish i didnt do that but thats a long time ago so its not a big deal now laughter stupid laughter immature laughter tisk um my parents some of my close friends i have i have a good group of three or four friends thatve been positive influences yeah mm a caring guy nice person good heart a little a little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to make himself better and uh passionate i guess passionate in a good and bad way laughter laughter well i care a lot and at the same time sometimes it gets the best of me mm tisk sometimes you feel like you know youre doing more for your friends or somebody like that youre doing more than they deserve and youre not its not being reciprocated so thats an example yeah probably but i cant think of anything off the top of my head tisk um focus more on school because while youre young you have the ability to multitask and scrubbedentry mm tisk i dont know really enjoyed i mean i do things everyday that i enjoy but really enjoyed i dont i dont know um i i i cleaned up a bunch of stuff from my room so it was nice to shed some old garbage so that that was alright but i dont know if i really enjoyed that but i felt content after it mm tisk not much its i mean its kinda sad i dont know uh laughter i think i could do better i feel like im an underachiever so not much i dont know im very detail oriented organized i like to finish tasks um i care a lot you know im very caring um i have good intentions in mind i dont like to wrong people i dont like to lie because once you lie one lie leads to another so i dont like that but yeah thats thats about it laughter cool right on have a good day
sync yes im okay uh los angeles laughter um i dont know laughter um its kinda dirty but thats to be expected from a big city um my the last class that i took was a sociology class um im not n im not really sure where im going with school but im thinking about sex education i think that its a really important job um uh i feel like uh because theres kind of uh stigma i guess about talking about sex it leads to like a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies so i feel like its a very important job for the world laughter i dont know laughter no um lack of funds um it depends on the people but id say that uh generally im more shy uh of course with people who i know well like theyre closer to me i im more outgoing um play with my dogs uh i dont know uh if its a nice day ill go for a walk um if its not a nice day then or if its cold out or something then uh maybe watch a show on tv i like or read a book or something id say im pretty good at controlling my temper um i cant remember i think the last person i argued with was my boyfriend probably last week but i dont even remember what it was about laughter um i dont think i really feel guilty about anything id say that i regret things but i think theres a difference between guilt and regret um like i think guilt is more just like feeling bad but regret is like um feeling like you shouldve made a different decision and i think that can help you in to make better decisions in the future whereas guilt you just feel bad for no reason and its useless laughter um i regret not doing better uh when i was in high school um uh i mean not getting better grades um i regret uh like getting involved with certain people in the past but i mean i dont im not sure laughter thats about it that i can think of right now laughter hm um uh yeah i mean i mean in the past uh yeah i couldve made different decisions i mean obviously some things you know you arent entirely in your control but im not going to feel im not going to regret things that i had no power over so um im not sure if i would want to erase it from my memory but i wish that it didnt happen to me uh was uh the time that i was raped laughter i cant really think of any hard decisions um hm i cant think of any laughter hm im not sure laughter i cant think of any uh i have a pretty good relationship with my family um uh not i wouldnt say that im really close with my mother but i mean we get along well and im very close with my sister were basically best friends um hm i think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life uh because she was always able to provide for me and she always she didnt i mean she made like mistakes sometimes but i think that she was always there for me when i needed it and um she just did her best to raise me so i think she was a big positive influence uh its been easy lately uh sometimes i have trouble sleeping but uh lately i have had no problems um it depends how long ive gone without sleep i can just be anywhere from like groggy to like um really on edge and like um extremely tired laughter i dont know um i have been feeling pretty good i uh i have like general anxiety kind of all the time but its not as bad as it has been in the past so been feeling mostly pretty good um i think that ive actually been feeling happier lately i wouldnt say that im like really happy all the time i mostly just kind of like um neutral but i have been feeling more positive lately im actually not sure if ive been diagnosed with ptsd um uh i know that i ive been seeing uh psychologist psyc psychologists for like since i was sixteen um for depression and uh i think my first psychologist who i saw for a few years thought that i had ptsd but im not sure if she ever made a diagnosis um im not sure laughter uh im laughter i dont know yes um its helpful to uh talk someone and have them kind of um guide you in talking about something so that you can figure thing the figure out your feelings about things sort of i guess for yourself or like why it it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why youre feeling a certain way about something i mean i think sometimes you can do that on your own but uh talking to somebody helps i think um hm im not sure laughter um im not sure laughter um im not sure laughter uh i think i would spend it mostly at home um but it would be sunny out and i would go outside a little bit and id play with my dogs and uh id probably have my boyfriend over um id eat food that i like like only food that i like like my favorite foods um watch movie or tv show that i like um just kind of have like a relaxing time but thats nice mm i would tell myself to uh to uh to do better in school because throughout high school i was kind of an underachiever and i ended up going to community college like on and off because i would like sort of lose interest and then uh not do well or as well as i could have so i would tell myself to do as well as i could in school because i feel like i am capable of a lot more than i do and i think i could easily have gotten a scholarship schol a scholarship if i had done well in high school so i would just tell myself to do good in school probably warn myself about one or two people that turned out to be not worth my time laughter um hm um i think i am proud of myself for not being um bitter and for wanting to uh well i am kind of bitter i guess but i guess im proud of myself for not being selfish and wanting to um make the world a better place like cause a lot of bad things have happened to me and i try to instead instead of dwell on them i try to um or i want to be able to make things better for other people and as much as i wanna help i guess um empower people to make their lives better bye

nothing that i can recall laughter something i feel guilty about hm theres nothing right now that i feel guilty about mm oh a situation that i wish i had handled differently i really cant think of one right now the hardest decision oh um the absolute hardest decision that i ever had to make um was when my uh i had twins twin twin twin boys theyre grown now i had twins twin teen teenagers and um i had lost my job and we were living in a motel and the rent for the motel was outrageous i couldnt no longer continue to pay the um pay the type the type of money that they wanted so i had to briefly um um put my son under the in in foster care for for for a minute that was the hardest decision that i had to make scrubbedentry um a schizophrenic and he had had um he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training with a speech therapist and and school officials and he also this is he also lost his hearing when he was four years old um but and then when he turned fourteen the schizophrenia came up um so right now he hes in a supportive living environment hes twenty seven years old um but he he hes come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now i had problems in the past cause he didnt wanna take the medication youd give him the medication and hed hide it stick it in his pocket or whatever so but hes come to terms with that and weve all have come to terms with that and hes doing hes doing pretty good scrubbedentry um that son hes twenty twen hes twenty seven as i said cause hes a twin um um was living in texas with his wife and um he got a promotion to um scrubbedentry now hes in california too both are in california okay so um i feel very good about that yeah uh hm well of grown children yes laughter of grown children yes no no no no no no no no i take that back not its not hard to be a parent of grown of my grown children okay when they were younger there were difficult times okay difficult periods and um just it was a lot of good times too but yeah it was there were some difficult times mm well the mm the difficult times i really pretty much already alluded to and that was when um one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and um and um they were in temporarily and in in well one was in foster care and one was actually um in a institution cause of the um the um schizophrenia um so think i lost track of the question laughter the hardest thing about being a parent at this point at this the at this point in my life there is is nothing hard about it um the best thing about being a parent i dont know i guess its just to see cough something that you created um develop into a you know pretty decent human being you know a decent person thats the best thing oh a lot of ways um well actually i didnt have two parents i had a mother and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so i had no contact with him um but the thing that i do differently than what my mother did um she was a strong disciplinarian um both verbally and physically um and she at she had this tendency which she outgrew she had this tendency to be very critical okay critical and um um opinionated laughter and very religious um and sort of sort of looked at people who were not and that was me um as if they were living life wrong because they were not going to church or reading the bible and that kind of thing what was the other part of the question i i i dont get a good nights sleep or i dont sleep at all unless i take medication and thats that thats all there is to it if i dont take medication i dont sleep ill be up all night ill i will be up for days if i dont take medication man irritable um and tired laughter well well lately you know just a little anxious really um you know um i just recently um made a move to a new apartment its a lot of expenses and new expenses and things like that you know and new furniture and new this and that that you have to get which um ive i managed to do all of that but um the whole thing was kind of stressful yes mhm no not ptsd yes um that was back in i think two thousand and four um because um my life had gotten so stressful to the point where it was either i had to do something or or end something to tell you the truth yeah um yes mhm yeah i think its useful um you know as a good sounding board you know someone to throw you know your concerns out and you know discuss things that may be bothering you or good things too yeah i think therapy with medication um since ive been going to therapy um the changes a lot of changes um ive been more focused more hopeful um hm it its just been a good experience for me which is why i continue to go really happy well i can feel really happy um by some occurrence i cant think of anything right now just like that and then i go back to how i was feeling so i cant really pinpoint anything really i mean eh eh i mean if something comes to me unexpectedly or if things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time that that makes me happy when things go right how about that hm mm something i did recently that i really something i did recently that i really enjoyed mean really really enjoyed recently hm i cant think of anything i dont have a best friend um my best qualities are that im a honest person i genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt um everyone in my book is as they appear to be until they prove prove it differently um im very generous overly generous laughter um and im very i like to help other people i mean help you know im on a personal level help people you know with anything whatever their problem is it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody else thats helping them out mhm anything i regret how so theres only one thing i regret and that is that um after my twins became um became old enough to um start going to um school the elementary school level um i was taking some courses um as a pre law major and um at that time i was married to their father who who turned out not to be a good fit for me and because of the stresses involved with him you know knowing that that was gonna end and i was gonna leave him um i dropped out of college so that was my biggest regret hm stay in school no matter what stay the course no matter what that im a good person im a good human being thats all okay goodbye
sync yes im good thank you um i was born in mexico city yes um about thirty four years ago yeah laughter um i try to go back once a year but i havent been in about three years um i havent had the time and ive traveled to other places but im planning on going back probably next year um well i cant ever see myself moving back to mexico city its a huge huge city and i like la more theres more opportunities and i just feel at home here my family moved here um i like i said s i was very young and my parents moved um to california to work and then we just stayed here um i love traveling i have not traveled as much as i would like to um but i do love to travel um just seeing new things meeting people from other countries just um feeling relaxed and having no worries because youre on vacation um i just love being  in other places um the last trip i took was a seven day cruise and it went to saint thomas barbados saint lucia um saint martin and it was amazing i would love to do that trip again um i think sigh going to mexico the last time i was there i went to the pyramids teotihuacan and i had not been there in many years and it just was amazing to see the pyramids and i cant even imagine how they were able to build such great um structures uh i consider myself more shy um in social situations i kind of feel uncomfortable um im not one to just go up to people and start conversations um if people come up to me of course ill talk to them but i feel slightly awkward just kind of out of place at a party um i actually studied history laughter um ive always been interested in history and i just wanted to learn about histories from other cultures and of course us history so im very into uh history um im actually working in uh the education field my dream job would actually be um traveling around the world and having a show on like the travel channel laughter that would be my dream job because i would get paid to travel and its something i enjoy to do doing um so i would love to do that as a job laughter laughter um i love reading and i love taking baths so to relax i like to take a bath and i read while im in the bath and um i also like going to the gym that helps me uh deal with stress and it actually relaxes me even though im exercising um i used to be not very good at controlling it when i was a kid i would get mad um very easily and sometimes as an adult i still get angry easily but ive gotten a lot better at trying to think about things first before saying them and not having outbursts things like that um the last time i argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was um my best friend and she actually she has kids i dont and for some reason she thought or thinks that i think im a better person than she is and because i went to school and she didnt and shes home with kids and you know im able to do more things um i dont think ive ever made her feel that i i and i definitely know i dont feel like im better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it um well that situation i wish i had handled differently um because when she was talking to me she was very upset and i started off pretty calm just trying to reason with her and let her know that i certaintly didnt feel like i was better than her but towards the end of the conversation it just kinda turned into a yelling match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and maybe asked her to call me later once we calmed down instead of just continuing the argument um i was angry at first but once we hung up i felt really bad about the situation i felt that maybe i couldve just let her let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly um instead of yelling at her too oh wow um thats a tough one i think um gosh i think one of the toughest tough hardest decisions ive had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of seven years um although i knew that it was the right thing to do i was kind of hanging on to the fact that we had been together for so many years and i kinda felt by ending the relationship um i wouldve wasted those last seven years of my life it was a pretty tough decision to make but i realized that it was the best decision for me at the time and im actually glad i did because then i went on to meet um my husband laughter thank you um well about i would say maybe fifteen years ago i was hanging out with a couple of friends at a club and they met some guys and um they invited us back to their place and i really didnt wanna go because i didnt know these people and i mean i knew their names and thats about it but my friends really wanted to go and i wasnt the one driving so i decided to just go along with them and back at their house um one of the guys actually pulled me into a room and tried i i got scared i yelled he tried to choke me and i thought i was gonna die right right there i thought he was gonna kill me but luckily one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left so it couldve been a worse situation but i still think about it and wish that i could erase it from my mind it was um we have a pretty good relationship i am close to i have a sister and a brother um my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older and we get along pretty well um my sister and i used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then um now were actually closer i think than ever and i have a pretty good relationship with my parents um my dad still treats me like im a little kid sometimes laughter which annoys me but i think we have a pretty good solid relationship yeah um sigh i usually wake up a few times throughout the night um so i think its rare for me to sleep uh the whole night through ever um and i do feel a little like tired in the morning when i wake up its hard im not a morning person definitely um so yeah its kinda hard to get a good nights sleep um i dont know it i have a hard time falling asleep and then sometimes i have bad dreams or i need to get up to use the restroom um but yeah it i dont remember the last time i actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once um emotionally good um im actually on vacation right now from work so thats really nice um physically i feel good i havent been to the gym in a while so that kinda makes me feel bad um cause i like working out um but health wise im good laughter no no um it was last la this past weekend i actually went out of town with my husband we didnt go very far we went to santa barbara but we really enjoyed ourselves um we went wine tasting and went to the beach and just had a really good time um she would probably describe me as a good caring person um patient very shy um shed probably say too that i have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors cause im always doing things for other people um so yeah thats how i think she would describe me i wish i was more outgoing um i wish that i what else definitely more outgoing um so i could have more friends i dont have a large group of friends because i am very shy um i also wish that i could have more patience than i do laughter sometimes im very short of patience and um i wish i could find a better job so i could do more traveling um yes i actually took a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree and i really wish that i couldve you know taken care of it a lot sooner than i did um and i also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex boyfriend um i wouldve told myself to stay focused on school that going out and hanging out and just you know and going to parties um was not as important as i thought it was and that my education should always come first um im proud that after so many years of not being in school i was able to go to ucla and get my degree um yeah that would be my proudest achievement laughter okay thank you bye
synch mm yes i am um im okay chicago um back and forth over the years and traveled a little bit havent been out there in over fifteen sixteen years um kinda got stuck out here laughter then i had my baby and i just stayed uh different food um the people get along way um how do i get it its kind of a culture shock uh out there just on the food basis they like to give you a lotta food that tastes real good for a little bit of money to keep a lifelong customer but out here they wanna go up there and give you a little bit of food for a whole lotta money so they just making money laughter um mm parent had business out here um not hard i could get used to anywhere the views and the ocean uh just uh a splitting of people thats it laughter um just a few places getting to see different people and learn how different people get along and interact with each other laughter um laughter uh sigh i remember a trip years ago where i went to mexico with my brother yeah um jumping into a lake laughter pretty much off the side of a mountain laughter yeah everything laughter theres not a subject i dont like um actually my dream job working with computers and helping people thats where wh where my heart is i like computers and i also like helping people laughter i meditate um work out i run i walk um i write read in the median mm id say very good oh yeah that doesnt make it seem that good laughter um last time i argued was over someone actually spitting out a racial slur towards my um wife angry upset hurt disrespected and especially when i went up there to treat the person actually i was treating em with dignity and respect and trying to help the person at first its no problem people are people mm i had a chance in school to really go a lot further than i did and i let something very small and meaningless stop me in the pursuit of it um laughter ignorance laughter for lack of a better word now that i think back on it i couldve done a whole lot to avoid it but i was just young and foolish to start living again deep breath sigh um as much pain as ive seen in the world um a compilation of all the events uh just different bad things that ive seen i if i could change it i would but sometimes i guess things are there for a reason even though we may not understand it laughter um i have no answer to that um blood family we really dont talk um my wife dont know if she really wants to be there with me or not she thinks that im doing everything in the world but that im not and really laughter i dont understand i know my daughter loves me but i dont know if she wants to be with me or not because when somebody talks to you when they say something a certain amount of times and the tonage in they voice and the belief in their eyes if you say something so many times its what really lies in your heart sharp inhale so you could say whatever through your mouth but its what really is there hmm i love my daughter she a angel i cut her umbilical cord i went out there and laughter put on her first shirt i seen her come out she looked at me right out the stomach laughter she wouldnt she was fighting with the doctors wouldnt let em touch her a bit i talked to her i told her to calm down or i told her it was daddy she looked up at me grabbed my fingers and like just calmed down and just let em do everything they needed to do laughter no its constantly changing task um what you have to do on this day wont be the same thing as the next or the next after that its constantly um what is a better word for it um laughter um adjusting laughter um the hardest thing ill probably say is scolding your child because you know youre doing it out of love for em not xxx learn the wrong lessons laughter seeing your baby smile in appreciation i try to guard my baby a lot more from things that she sees um when i was younger there were a lotta things that i seen that no child or adult shouldve seen and um when whe i grew up i swore to myself that ill always take care of my child and i wouldnt disappear or let her be around things like that um my old foster parents mm they basically showed me no matter where you come from you can always strive to get better um a good nights sleep eh um it comes laughter the same just tired and yawning laughter how have i been feeling mm like i have a wealth of queries and a wealth of gold within my grasp and its just right out of my reach because i just need that one connector to really just see what im capable of and i know im capable of a lot its just i need to make that connection no sigh um mm not ptsd no uh i said yes but i dont figure im any more depressed or anything than any other person everyone has their different breaking points my daughters birthday on the twenty sixth um took her out to chuck e cheese she had fun she played games she was on bikes deep breath she was crawling through puzzle games um man this girl did about everything laughter um fun loyal caring sigh um something to change i would like to be more accurate sigh not getting to know who my mom was stop thinking about whatever else has happened and just do what you need to do im positive im goaloriented determined um im very imaginative very creative laughter ideal i would probably be doing a little bit of everything rock climbing biking hiking going with my daughter places um laughter man ill probably be skiing snowboarding and everything laughter in a ideal weekend my daughter no problem goodbye
synch yes thats fine im okay how are you laughter originally im from san francisco um originally i moved here in gosh nineteen ninety five then i went to chicago then to san francisco and then back to los angeles probably about five years ago a lotta moving laughter never um there just isnt anything there for me anymore uh the weather is better in la but the people in san francisco are nicer my husband prefers pref my exhusband prefers it here thats why we moved i have an undergraduate degree in psychology and uh after that i went to law school uh when i was in college i worked at a law firm and decided that i really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting no now im a stayathome mom scrubbedentry no um i love it but it is it is difficult you have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person uh sigh i its easy to kinda do the academics and stuff like that you know im good at that the hardest thing i think is to guide them emotionally to help him through things that hes having a hard time with um feeling like i dont have all the answers um just seeing them grow and and experience new things and learn about life and the world its just its really really cool uh completely different laughter um completely different i and i am not a perfect parent but i love my son i take care of him hes the first priority in my life and they werent like that at all um well my parents are dead i didnt speak to my dad at all before he died um i have a sister and a brother that actually i dont know where they are i dont speak to them either um probably more shy because i consider myself more reserved laughter laughter um i like to listen to music i have i listen to all sorts of music but my favorite when im relaxing is uh eighties music laughter cheesy cheesy but true um it depends on who im with if im with my son i can control my temper um if im with my exhusband or other adults mm yeah ye yeah i dont soso um yesterday and it was about my exhusband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married um i found out he was cheating on me and i kicked him out and he told me yesterday that hes continuing to date her yeah um really angry and just really hurt um i wish that i had talked to my dad before he died i wish that id settled our differences before he had died the hardest decision ive ever had to make was actually ending my marriage because he was cheating on me um that would have to be well i dont know i mean i dont know if id want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who i am today so i i cant really think of one event that i would want to erase uh i dont get a good nights sleep its not easy i wake up a lot in the night i dont know i wish i knew laughter if i knew i i could change it i could try to do something about it but i i just dont i dont know um grumpy irritable uh grumpy irritable um down mixed with anger sigh its just because of everything that im going through with my soontobe exhusband yeah theres um i just keep it inside i mean theres nothing else to really do except exce i mean it is what it is so i have to deal with it no yes deep breath ten years ago after my son was born or nine years ago um i felt like i couldnt cope with life i was so down um i couldnt i felt like i couldnt do anything no i dont go to therapy i go to medication management but i dont d i dont do talk therapy i have gone to therapists and no they dont help um well some just sit and stare at you and dont say anything um you know if i wanted to talk to myself i would others give advice that i think is just it just not not good and not on point um it was probably this morning i was playing with my son just really happy i wasnt thinking about any of the other crap sigh um in my life i could just forget it so i was feeling really really happy ugh i think they would describe me completely different from the way i would describe me but um i think they would describe me as really sweet uh cause they have really sweet um confident uh outgoing because thats what i try to be to people so i think thats how they would describe me uh i wish i wasnt sad i wish i was more confident um yeah there are a lotta things i think uh it would be to not not give my life over to one particular person which is what i did with my husband i think i would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like palm springs with my son hanging around the pool having fun going out to dinner uh one of my two of my friends two really good girlfriends i think have been really positive influences in my life um scrubbedentry she sh her life is worse than mine and uh laughter but we can always commiserate together scrubbedentry is just really positive i mean shes always happy always up always looking to the bright side so that has helped me a lot my son um i went over to a friends house and we had movie night we watched a grownup movie and had dinner and wine and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening mhm sure laughter bye
synch hi sure alright uh originally originally im from uh korea mhm uh when i was a year old yes uh almost never ive ive been to korea once uh i love the weather sigh and being by the ocean and the culture has a lotta things to do the food theres a lot to like um the traffic um it seems like were having a lot of uh economic difficulties and the the parking tickets are super high i sometimes im really annoyed by our government laughter by your shoes did you say by your shoes laughter your shoes arent showing um i have traveled a bit im im sort of traveled i havent traveled in a little bit in a little while oh just sigh it um it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here um its exciting and it makes me feel like um im actually act im really living cause sometimes were stuck in this bubble here in la and seeing other places you realize that you know life is about a lotta different things that you dont think about every day well um one of my trips i went uh i went to singapore and then to thailand and it was when i was with my exboyfriend and we went to um he had ha he was uh uh a sales engineer or systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this was kind of like a a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days and that was really interesting um you know of course eh its a lot different over there um not just like going to canada or something but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principals of the company which was real fun and um after singapore uh we did some tours in singapore it was really it was a interesting experience its really clean there and its really theres not a lotta crime but the government is very it its a little bit imposing but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost almo it was really completely different cause its like jungle we went to um phuket its a little island and it was just it was very primitive compared to singapore just in a lotta different ways but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap had a massage on the beach for eight dollars laughter it was interesting yeah yeah it was an hour for eight dollars laughter mm well im in school right now and um i didnt i didnt finish school when i was younger because i had um i had health problems so um here i am im im just doing my general ed right now im going to smc yeah im happy ooh sigh well my dream job would be sigh to be a veterinarian but uh its probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and in in a veterinary capacity yeah i think im right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people im with and how comfortable i am but um im really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and ill be really reserved laughter if im not yeah laughter laughter uh sigh well i mean aside from sleeping um i like like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand or um if im at home uh just like reading or a lotta times i can just lay there and my mind might be doing things but im kinda relaxing ah really good i dont have i would say theres certain things that um they can really like make me like when i see injustices or things like that then i mean i can really feel it but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or uh even you know yell laughter sigh argued um sigh i cant really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument like if we just well uh i would say last summer when um i think it was after a baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to we went to have shabu shabu after the game and i dont know i think scrubbedentry and i dont know its its its kind of a tenuous friendship like mm shes a good friend in some ways and shes mm were were actually kinda distant in other ways so i i dont consider her um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any deep problems but um sometimes we just have shes very touchy and she doesnt have the same sense of humor i do so i think she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm you know i just kinda thats just how she is and then i guess i said some things that she felt were eh well she gets really offended easily i think laughter but um after that we didnt talk for a while but then we then one day she called me up and then we were friends again but like she never she never confronted me hardest decision sigh uh it was leaving my exboyfriend uh well it wasnt sigh it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it for like five years um you know he wasnt like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just had a lot of um we w we werent always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements so i had thought about it and thought about it and we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so i dont know uh i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally eh we were just always having um we were always what whats the word im looking for um we were just having these little snippy disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and um i did it was really hard it was it was the hardest decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um and but i i think it was for the best deep breath sigh hmm um probably leaving my job for well to help my friend start a business in nevada and when i when i i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome and that was really stressful for me because um id already promised my friend laughter to leave i wouldnt have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasnt for her wanting me to come over there um it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left and um when i went over there like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah when i got there everything like she didnt remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and the other principals of the company were um you know the th it was a hard situation cause she had she had talked with me but they hadnt talked with me and theyre like well thats too much and also they were a different religion and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion laughter i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i dont have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh eh i was kind of an outsider there and then also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there laughter so i would say thats one decision it its it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um i really wish i i had just stayed laughter um well if youre gonna erase something from my memory then laughter um i would probably say sigh my memory like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase is that what youre saying mm sigh cant really think of anything i mean even like that that bad decision that i made you know it it has value in it so sigh i cant really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something and it was really sigh horrifying then i would but i dont sigh well if youre talking about sleep s being in a deep sleep im in a deep sleep a lot but i never feel rested and thats um its a medical problem of mine well i always feel like i havent slept for two days and um there are points in in the day i would say in some s during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and and rested but theyre shortlived but i sleep a lot i sleep uh pretty crappy laughter physically pretty crappy yeah well thanks laughter no sniffle i havent been officially diagnosed with depression but um thats thats usually what doctors um like my sleeping problem hasnt been diagnosed im im in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but um thats the first thing that they try and figure out they theyve given me like depression drugs before but they havent helped with my sleep but i do sigh i do sigh i would say i feel down sometimes someti well my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down um i would say that i do feel down sometimes a lotta times but its not i would say its reasonable considering the situations that im in uh theyre just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult but um i wouldnt say its triggered by anything in particular oh there i mean sigh you mean for a long period of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know ive find some great new dish i like i mean what type of happiness are you looking for um sigh well i mean right now um my friend just had surgery and so im staying with her this week um im really enjoying it i mean even though we could never live together i could never live with live with her long term and im sure she couldnt live with me long term but im having fun and um you know she just she i i installed the groupon app on her ah on her phone um yesterday cause shes been paying too much for laser hair removal laughter and so i installed it on her phone and then today shes shes looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her uh as a groupon deal so i mean you know theres little fun things like that sniffle uh sigh probably um ocd laughter and um she probably thinks im pretty prissy compared to her um i think that she would say that i have a good heart um were very different um and probably that im sigh i should ask her laughter uh i dont know we we go out so i think shed say that im fun um but she has mentioned that im im a very private person and that i know i i knew before she said that why um sigh i have ha well i told you i have i have a lotta problems right now and sigh so i dont really tell people about them um it its kind of a its kind of a killjoy but also people can feel i feel that people can feel less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of um it just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help or they feel guilty but they have good busy lives so just kinda creates a gap but i would say even before even before this difficult time in my life ive been ive been a private person i dont know why i think thi i think a lot eh you know im a deep thinker and maybe its just you know not like i feels like i feel abnormal but um maybe i just have a lotta thoughts that dont seem doesnt seem appropriate to share with people or im not sure sniffle ten or twenty years ago sigh um well one thing that i regret right now is um you know i havent really found somebody you know to spend the rest of my life with so i would tell myself to concentrate more on that cause once you hit forty its really rea its its a lot harder thats it um i would say sigh that ive perservered im very proud that even though i have a lot of difficulties in my life the fact that im you know making this commitment to go to school and im doing it on my own and um you know its its kind of a if people if people knew all the problems that i have theyd be like well you know why are you worrying about school but um i really feel that you know im im doing this and and im really proud that even through everything um yeah im getting as thanks mm k thanks bye
sync yes im doing well los angeles the greater los angeles area people diversity and various entertainment and activities um fickle weather traffic and litter i have traveled domestically not internationally seeing other places and how people live and the culture the last trip that i went to was san diego but uh from childhood or as an adult um family vacations to um baja and rosarito beach yeah the reason why that memory comes to mind because um this weekend is easter and we usually will go down to easter east easter spring break to rosarito baja um i have a bachelors b bachelors in communication studies because its a open field just doesnt deal with um communication interactively but performing arts telecommunications business entrepreneurship so no im not im actually unemployed um i think to own my business thats my dream my dream job to have my own company um i would like to open something in like the telecommunications area as a business something do online online services um i like to make things with my hands so my next venture would would be to create all natural soy candles something in that area um a mixture a mixture of shy and outgoing because i have to observe people and crowds and thats how i usually make a determination if i remain reserved or remain open i listen to like a meditation tape or i take a walk or go get a massage fair oh man laughter uh probably yesterday or this morning um usually the argument is about me making myself clear or me repeating myself twice no it usually gets the other person in trouble mm i redeemed a service from a mechanic who fixed my transmission and i had a warranty and i wrote to the department of consumer affairs and the guy offered me a portion of the settlement agreement and i decided to take him to small claims court to get a bigger amount and i wish i wouldve have taken the offer that he gave me at the midst of dealing with the third party which was the department of consumer affairs and because of that i took him to small claims court and i end up losing the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion so i wish i wouldve taken the higher road than taken the lower road i dont tend to feel guilty about too many things hardest decision uh i dont know financially emotionally mm emotionally letting go a past relationship its the hardest thing that i i wont say the hardest thing but it was a difficult thing yes it was a relationship of seven years but um that person has already moved on so uh they want me to be in their life in hopes that if something goes wrong with my current relationship well always have something to fall back on uh yeah it is hard um an event something i could erase from my memory um i dont know laughter theres a lot of events that i just automatically erase from my memory but whatever comes to mind right um probably the death of a relative um alone and misinformed because i didnt know that they were that sick and i didnt know that they were um their days were numbered and i couldve had more opportunity to spend time with them and make better a better connection in the last days um its fair to midland mm my immediate im very close but distant not very close my mother um yes uh shes encouraged me to continue my education to always fall back on my hobbies hopes goals and dreams she always encourages me to always stay aloof and out there looking for a better opportunity and she encourages me to not be afraid to explore other ventures easy laughter easy laughter ive been feeling well um yes a little stressed but im trying to manage that i leave the stressful environment um in the past about three years ago um because i was having issues in my learning environment and um i feeling f i was feeling emotionally attacked yeah i was having uh a issue with a professor who was just very i dont know a a very different personality and he almost ran me down the crosswalk at school i felt i felt um like i was in a a dishonest environment i felt like i wanted to get you know switch his class and get into another class but i had no choice but to stay in there and deal with his meanness for the whole semester um i think through finding ptsd they were trying to link depression no financially im not capable and i havent found a counselor who is willing and committed to working with me and helping me with my issues i find that a lot of counselors they listen to me and then they laugh at me and then they tell me the opposite of whats what im telling them mhm mm last time i felt really happy i really dont know thats a good question um just just did what i want i just relaxed i just relaxed and i you know i dont know laughter i dont have any best friends my best qualities that im uh hard working im reliable im a excellent friend um im energetic and im a go getter things that i wish i could change about myself probably be less sensitive dont take things so personally and um learn how to help myself before helping others no i dont have any regrets in my life um if i couldve do things differently ten years ago i probably wouldve focused and studied more and less being out of the house and hanging with friends mm that i got have a a college education and im self sufficient and i can pay my bills by myself laughter and im alive goodbye
sync hi yes today is a wonderful day i am doing just absolutely marvelous i was born in cleveland ohio i was raised in tucson arizona and came to los angeles when i was sixteen years old yes mm uh ive only been back once since i left its a whole another community when i was growing up im so glad i grew up there because it was a great sense of community which i think we dont have here in los angeles sniffle uh my my grandmother died and left property for my father so we came here to manage her property property uh it was pretty easy for me i was still young and it was easy to adapt so im pretty good at meeting people so uh that has never been a problem i traveled a lot as a child so i was used to moving and going to new places meeting new people seeing new things its an adventure and i like the adventurous life oh one of my best trips i had it was in nineteen im dating myself but nineteen sixty four sniffle i came out here to visit my grandmother from cleveland ohio and i went to an indian reservation and i got a little note card about the reservation when i got back home i wrote to the reservation and i told them i when i came ca went back to school in september i would have to write uh deliver a speech rather about what i did over the summer and i told them i wanted to talk about going to the indian reservation and would they send me something and they sent me this huge kachina indian doll and that was wa that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth now if i still had it i found out like a quarter of a million dollars so laughter mm but thats one of the best xxx um i could be a little bit of both um im pretty when i have to be i can be outgoing cause im good at meeting mee talking to people and meeting people but sometimes i have a little bashful side a little shy side of me too so so a little bit of both i studied business administration ad administration with a uh emphasis in marketing and advertising um well i really i started in computer science but that was back in the day when computer science wasnt this what it is today and um i liked li i was good at it but it wasnt any interaction with people and i love people so i wanted something that would bring me interaction with people so i went into marketing and i was working for a tv station where i was going to school so that fit in line in marketing advertising so no now im a photographer im a celebrity photographer i shoot a lot of stars i shoot on the red carpet i shoot a lot of special events and anything else people will pay me for laughter its not hard at all its my passion i love it its like not working im in my dream job i i just need to get more jobs j jobs to that pay pay me well because theres a lot of times as a photographer you have to do a lot of things thin events for free to get known so its a building process of relationships so im still in that process of building relationships so that i can get more paid jobs but this is my dream job i love what i do laughter well now im really back into it i used to do it a while then i got away from it but its meditation i practice meditation and i try to do it twice a day in the morning and at night before i go to sleep i work with oprah and deepak chopra and anybody else who provides me with meditation and i use that to calm my body um i can generally control my temper sometimes i get set off i guess like any other human person per being but i work at trying to keep a moderate and temperate uh temper in personality oh wow we i argued with my daughter the other day about something i said and i did not mean to say it to hurt her but it obviously did and we argued about that what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt her mm and maybe what i said did and thats what started the argument oh god i felt terrible because i i never intended to hurt my daughter and i never would wanna hurt her and i felt bad that she had been hurt by what i had said so i had to have to guard my words and watch my thoughts well i dont have much of a relationship with my family f with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away so its just my two daughters here with me and we have a pretty good relationship you know we try to work my my daughters a makeup artist and im a photographer so we work a lot together in the industry so sometimes i think were up on each other too close we need a little more space yeah when i say the wrong things laughter its no its never easy to be a parent its a work in progress making the right decisions about things sometimes the love the feel the feeling of accomplishment that you were able to raise the highest creation on this planet to be a a uh wonderful and productive human being im not as strict as my parents were i give my kids a little more freedom to find out who they are um im not real religious like they do but i am very spiritual um so i brought them up different from me on the religious tip and um im more i listen more to them i think than what my parents did it was you were to be seen and not heard when i was growing up and i let my kids voice be heard one night i had a bad night that changed my life and i dont know wanna go into details i feel bad about that night laughter yeah i couldve stayed home laughter wow im trying to think about a situation maybe the handling of how i me and my husband divorced i think i couldve handled that a little differently well we we i think we really loved each other a lot and we just it was it was something that had come to a a end and the way we separated was kind of explosive and i think both of us couldve handled it better but i think i played a part in in keeping a lot of drama going cause i was hurt that we were breaking up and kinda devastated cause i wanted my child to be raised with her father so i think it looking back now which is you know hindsight is twenty twenty vision i couldve handled things a little better but what can you do you do the best that you can at that time if you knew better youd do better the hardest decision ive ever had to make the hardest decision ive ever had to make was i was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on a plane had a stroke was going to make an a connection and to get on the other plane to and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me and he told me that i could not get on that plane because i might have another stroke that was a hard decision cause i was in dallas texas all by myself i did not i mean i was in there with an employee but i would be left all by myself cause my employees had to go on to montgomery alabama where we were headed and i had to make a decision should i stay or should i go but my life was in the balance so i made the decision to stay and go to the hospital but that was a hard one sniffle ugh overwhelmed i mean here i am on my way to work you know i flew to different states every week and uh to help kids get get admitted into college and here i am on my way to work and im on a plane and i feel this weird feeling coming over the left side of my body and i say my prayers and i go to sleep and then when i wake up to get off the plane i cant remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which i did every week so i knew something was wrong it was it was when you to your life and the whole world in your hand and you dont know whats gonna happen next so it was very disturbing very traumatic and i you know you dont know whats happening to you its so the weirdest thing riding to the hospital in a medical ambulance that was a weird experience yeah but im here i you know i survived it the doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and i survived so the universe wasnt finished with me yet you know what thats sometimes i have a little problem with it um sleeping a little bit sometimes i i get wired up laughter i get wired up just because im one of those real energetic persons and i have to finish what i set out to do and until i finish i cant go to sleep so sometimes its hard for me to go to sleep other times i can lay down and just go but depends on whats going on in my head um im sluggish um probably a little on edge but i try and keep a a upbeat personality im a real energetic person so i try to but you know if youre tired your body is still talking to you so lately ive been feeling really well um except ive been having some problems because i have a um since i had the stroke i have nerve damage in my hand and in my face and so i just its i thought its been over a year since i had the stroke but i thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it hasnt but im so grateful to be alive that that is really minor mi minor compared to the bigger picture and i wasnt fortunately for fortunately my i didnt lose my facial structure or you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are i still can use my hands i still can shoot with my camera even though my left hand is is diminished in use but i can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so i can still keep doing my work um so you know i have to keep a good upbeat energy going on for me to keep for me to be successful no but i went through depression uh from being knocked unconscious five times when i was a school teacher every ball there was that you could name soccer ball baseball basketball name that ball hit me in my head and i suffered from having like sleep apnea and not being able to sleep from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head so no only i dont go to therapy because um i dont i dont have any medical right now so im not able to get therapy they only offer that to people with medical its hard to get it sniffle and then i dont im not working work yeah it sucks im not working right now because im still trying to get my disability so that i can get well cause i wanna be a fulfilled human being and i wanna be totally and you know the system itll be almost two years before i go for a hearing so thats kind of depressing to think after all the years ive been working since i was sixteen and its taking me its been over a year it was a year i had the stroke february two thousand twelve and we are now in march of two thousand thirteen and i wont have a hearing until september two thousand thirteen just to tell me if i get the disability or not thats been very depressing for me because im wondering where i lived off my savings in the last year and i got put my daughter through college she finished and now shes having to take care of me and shes still looking for a job and my life is kinda up in the air right now cause im wondering what comes next and so im just praying for guidance sniffle i feel happy every day every day i wake up and i can breathe and i can see and i can walk and i can talk and i can still shoot my photograph im happy its just a good thing to be in the present moment and to be alive sniffle mm you know what i figured like what good are regrets you cant change the past all you can do is change right here and right now so just live li move forward mm what advice would i give myself sniffle dont let anything get in your way you know keep a good personality and a energetic spirit and just keep pushing energetic talkative uh wont take no for an answer uh follow through reliable um good spirited giving loving um im most proud of that i have been able to find out my creative side ive been a visual artist i never took a art lesson before i taught art sniffle um i was in my late twenties before i even discovered that i could draw and paint um im a doll collector uh im im my creative side is what im most proud of because its been able to help me being creative i can no matter what even when i i was still very ill from having a stroke i could still go out and just go take pictures and that was so soothing to my soul that im im im glad that i have a creative side and that i found it and have utilized it mhm uh huh and thats is that it bye bye bye
synch yes im okay im feeling a little tired and uh worried um well im looking for a place to live and um i dont have a job right now so things are sigh things are a little shaky for me im staying with my son in venice uh its pretty good but uh both of us need to have our own space so thats why im looking for another place to live originally from new york but ive been in california since the early seventies so yeah uh i moved to la because i had been living in portland oregon and i was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here so it seemed like a good place to be um it wasnt too hard i uh i met people right away and um i just really like it here so it was uh it was easy to connect with people the weather is laughter number one like for most people i love being near the ocean um i like the energy i like the um i like the artistic culture mhm uh well everybody loves the traffic i mean loves the weather and hates the traffic so i kinda feel fee i feel the same way um sometimes it it gets a little wearing that its so busy and the fact that its so expensive makes it difficult uh no not as much as id like if if i had more funds fu more income more funds i would travel more um sigh well mostly ive been um xxx i traveled lets see so my longest uh trip that was out of the country was to mexico and i traveled drove down with a friend uh down to oaxaca and the whole trip we took about mm i think we took us about four weeks going down and back from uh the bay area um yeah that was a fun trip well uh wed been working together on the census and she had made that trip a few times and invited me to come along with her um from that trip i would say we were in oaxaca for day of the dead so it was uh celebrating day of the dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in and everybody in the village makes an altar in their house uh for their uh loved ones who have passed away and um they also decorate clean and decorate the graves so there were lots of flowers and it was just it was neat to be there and be with that family celebrating that uh well i studied studi i was in the liberal liberal arts program but i didnt stay st i stayed only stayed in school for uh in college for a couple of years um but i was most interested in liberal arts and the humanities huh my dream job would be uh personal assisting somebody who was in a creative field and getting to uh travel and go to events with them uh its hard to break into um i im starting now very uh minimally with somebody who im doing more of a volunteer work with and im im working on building up some of my skills so that i can be doing more of that im fairly im kind of a friendly introvert so um i im you know i have no trouble meeting people uh i dont hold back and um you know xxx just im not shy sh like shy at parties ill go up and talk to people um but i i am overall kind of introverted so um i prefer oneonone than big groups um i like to watch uh well i laughter i like to watch uh improvement shows like on uh hgtv i like to watch um like remodel shows and and see transformations or or watch movies or read oh and and i play some solitaire on my uh my kindle fire um i dont usually realize im mad until later laughter so laughter it doesnt really come up um and i i just tend not to have the kind of life where um those situations arise uh sometimes you know sometimes on the road um i get a little annoyed uh i dont get annoyed so much at like when people cut me off or anything like that um but when people are deliberately rude and and you know honk for no reason or um you know when they get angry because maybe ive done something inadvertent you know cut them off by mistake and they the you know like they get really angry then that makes me angry in return hmm sigh um yeah like i said i dont really get into arguments um i did have ha i was with a friend the other day and um she got annoyed with me because she felt like i was correcting her so it wasnt really an argument but she you know i had said something that she heard as a correction well it was a correction and she got angry um but um well then i felt criticized and i felt i felt vulnerable eh i wasnt it was it was pretty uncomfortable hmm um well i in that situation i didnt i didnt have to correct her um so sigh i think thats something im starting to look at in myself is my need to be right so in general thats im trying to to catch that and just let people make mistakes without laughter without my telling them about it mm hmm boy i dont know um gee thats tough i cant i dont know that ive had that much trouble making decisions um hmm well uh u uh was hard for me to decide to uh put my cat to sleep when he was sick oh it was wa and i had to give up a cat um when i was moving once and and that was difficult too cause um sigh well in the case of the first cat the one who was sick um i decided when the vet said that he thought it was the humane decision um and with the cat i had to give up i didnt i didnt really decide um i was moving to a place that where i couldnt take her and so i i found somebody who could take her hmm sigh mm see um gee thats tough sigh if i dont really eh the the erasing from the memory part um theres nothing i really wish i could erase from my memory um trying to think of something that ive done that i wish i hadnt done um oh okay i remember something there was wa laughter there was a time when i was i was in a class at junior college it was a film class and uh i was i was the one who was um after we we went out and did a little film project um and were supposed to bring it back into class the next week uh i was the one who had the film and through different just things that were happening in my life right now i never went back to the school but i never brought them the film back so all the work they had done um they had to do over again and i still feel bad about that eh its pretty easy um sometimes i wake up in the early morning hours and and have trouble going back to sleep but thats not very often ive been feeling kind of tired and low level depressed and like not feeling a lot of options no yes i have uh well there were two times there was once um back in like nineteen seventy two nineteen ninetee yeah about nine nineteen seventy two or three and then um another time um oh so then when would thatve been about sixteen years ago um just feeling like there wasnt um you know feeling that feeling that things werent gonna change if i didnt get some help and that if i i didnt have to you know that maybe if some s i got some medication that would help me um in the short term so im not going to therapy right now uh i was moving around a lot finances i wasnt really feeling the need um im starting to think it might be a an option again i feel like therapy can be useful yes well when i went to therapy um it was helpful to have somebody who listened and could also offer impartial suggestions for helping me to improve the way i was feeling deep breath um sigh well i was on the beach last weekend uh it was a beautiful day and i was sitting in the sun and uh just relaxing and i had my notebook and i was doing some writing and i felt very happy and content uh im kind and compassionate and im a good listener and im intelligent and i have uh i have good ideas um sigh well i wish that uh sometimes i wish i was wa i was a harder worker um im not really willing to take low wage jobs even though i i need work so i just dont feel like im willing to do anything um and um i wish i could act i i said i had good ideas that um i have good ideas and im good at the uh the onset but im not really good on the followthrough so a lot of those ideas get started but then i dont take them the distance thats probably the the thing id like to change about myself the most uh ten or twenty years ago id give myself the advice to go back to school and get my degree finish my education um and be willing to um to work a regular job and to um to start putting money away for my uh retirement um proud of uh my children and im proud of the friendships i have and im proud that um eh that people eh people do eh admire me um and value my opinion goodbye
sync yes im alright south la um the weather the women the opportunities thats about it racism police brutality injustice thats it mm no not much of a exploring type of person um psychology mhm um it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology yeah yes no to own my own record label um it its moderately hard but you know take it one day at a time just i guess you know stay focused a little bit of both um i tend to be shy in um situations im not comfortable with or im new to and im outgoing in places im more comfortable with yeah laughter um turn the lights down low and listen to soft music mhm im getting better over the years um i think im pretty decent now compared to how i used to be yes maam um due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison yeah mm im not sure uh i dont really have a recollection of my hardest decision ive made in my life um it was probably a few days ago with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness yeah uh frustrated because um you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect you know the same effort by the other person when youre in a relationship and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so you know i guess im just learning theres a lot of situations i wouldve handled differently um probably the most recent was uh i had gotten into a physical phy a physical altercation with an inmate when i was incarcerated and that made me thats what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time and um if i handled it differently i probably wouldve never went to prison i probably wouldve been home a lot sooner than i originally happen yeah mm there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory um probably uh my first girlfriend um she did something really uh extreme it wasnt necessary in my eyes and it and it cost co it couldve cost me my life i think that that thats a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory along with the good memories as well um a few you few fights uh i guess you could say shoot outs um getting jumped getting robbed you know those things i think those inhibit me i guess to to explore certain areas of life that im not comfortable with so those are the feww things that itd be nice if i could erase it completely yeah sigh hurting people that didnt need to be hurt emotionally especially um a few women in my life or in my past um probably putting my mother through certain things that she didnt have to go through along with my close friends and family as well um used to be rocky growing up but as i got older and matured and the certain experiences that ive been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now its it its pretty decent its its pretty decent mm i would say my mother um yeah my mother um well she she uh she had her share of experiences negative and positive um i admire her the struggles shes been through um she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up but that didnt stop her um from raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her masters and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well and um probably not the best of family that she couldve been raised with so she so shes kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother mm its not easy so yeah its not easy i couldnt tell you i i ive always had sleeping issues um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so its like its a negative effect really yeah the medication medi i dont know shit i dont know but i just stopped taking it cause i didnt like feeling drowsy not good at all um yeah i mean i recently got released from prison not too long ago uh im older now and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where its supposed to be i feel like i couldve made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that ive been through and the whole nine yards so yeah its all good yeah so true yes sniffle about two and a half three years ago deep breath sigh myself i um i was i was just tired of not i dont know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to understand myself how my brain works um you know so i decided to seek help maybe to better my life yeah you could say that yes i am yes yes i do actually i do mm better decision making um better tools to reflect on choices um how to control uh certain situations better yeah um sniffle well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is i step back and and and i assess the situation you know to see whats whats the best way to to react towards the situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally more mature and just has a positive outcome laughter um i was lying next to a beautiful woman who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy oh my goodness spontaneous um outgoing sometimes a little crazy um fun thats about it nothing um like i said earlier just you know hurting the the few women that were in my life my past and my friends and family thats about it oh shit uh school is really important um how i carry myself the people who i surround myself with and what i choose to do in my free time those are the few things i would tell myself good music um a good game of basketball um sex um i like going out i like going to parties um social gatherings where everyones friendly and and theres no drama thats what i like dancing beautiful women a couple drinks thats about it um i guess not not necessarily giving up and and um just just i dont know just keep going just just not giving up really yeah mhm bye bye

doesnt compare to new york its um laughter people can be unbearable when theyre rude um not as much as id like lately i traveled more in the past but uh not lately no i just think seeing different places its um learning new things uh finding things that are fascinating that peak my interest um lets see i think laughter spoke of new york earlier i think the first time i went to new york i was quite amazed i know its uh still st still only in america but i just think um being from la i didnt think anything or any city could be bigger and more uh how do you say uh ostentatious than new york but uh it was it was quite an experience and uh i didnt think any place was uh i didnt di i didnt think any place was dirtier than downtown la laughter but i think times time i think laughter times squares got us beat too many to mention i i dont even know where to start suppose it depends on the situation um i like to walk i like to uh i like to play with my dogs uh reading uh anything where i guess i suppose i could just sit still let and let my mind go blank i know reading requires some concentration but uh you know just uh things that uh i dont have to um exert myself too much uh helps

loving argument laughter if if you will uh i met this roommate about six seven years ago we just uh kind of um kinda moved around the same social circles and just got along its cool i mean guess you know like we do argue uh we have our differences sometimes but theres not one person id rather have id rather live with than than her shes shes cool hmm how much time do we have uh laughter its just too numerous to mention um i i i wouldnt know how to answer that i think breaking up with a girlfriend that i truly cared about but knowing knowing that it just wasnt going to work um that was very difficult just weighed pros and cons and just thought it just wasnt going to work um no matter how much love or care i brought to the relationship there was something missing and i think i invested enough time she invested enough time and just knew it was over no so many laughter i dont have too many regrets but things you erase from your memory oh theres a lot uh too numerous to mention i dont

synch im cool fine new york yep eh about six months six months ago nicer pace uh photography job its a good move mm uh i love the weather cool people relax easy to talk to uh nice environment mm crime when you go through some sections yeah ive done my share uh the ability to sigh capture events be a part of it be a part of exciting things like um olympics games festivals uh special shows yeah meet new people yeah which one mm canada uh it was nice uh very refreshing mm clean environment uh the people seemed very very lighthearted but youre able to do serious work i love the landscape uh i think it was riding onboard an amtrak train yeah uh liberated photography uh i think im doing it you know i really re i i really believe im doing it um not very difficult you know uh um not at least not for me because i think i have some natural inclination for it uh and um i connect well with people im more shy but im forced to be outgoing because i you know you cant really get anything done being shy but given a choice id rather be um you know a little more pulled back laughter uh until i you know i i i feel like just the closest a safe path to go so that kinda curtails with my spirit of adventure sometimes i think an example hmm well an example of what exactly you mean what aspect okay well example like uh traveling sometimes you wanna go to a particular place and its uh something great happening there even though its a great place but its not such a cool place to go like take for instance like boston i used to go there a lot um now you know everybody i talk to is like a little bit nervous whether they should go there laughter you know to do you know uh um xxx you know have a great time you know i think its because of all the disturbance that just happened kinda you know throws you off track a bit make you rethink um is that a good getaway spot still right now something like that you know mhm mm uh me i huh i take walks i call up a friend we have tea or something you know uh i think i pretty much gotten that under control mm eh uh it was probably something silly in a work situation that last about five minutes and oh pretty much havent fought again i dont really dwell on negative things too much uh um i dont have any regrets right now mm i really cant think of anything right off the top the hardest decision ive ever had to make was uh not hiring a good friend uh for a job that you know they werent qualified for thats hard uh because you have to explain to them that its not the friendship youre hiring its their competence my father uh he just uh taught me how to you know uh overcome uh difficulties when i was growing up and how important it was to not give up uh and be able to see the bright side of any situation you face because it goes away you know if you hold in there long enough and i i found that to be true so mhm um its okay except exce except for some of my uh my distant siblings you know i dont see as often as i can mm yeah uh just you know when you when you travel quite a bit you just dont see people cause laughter theyre not always there you know uh its nothing like mhm yeah mhm uh well you know im im i get pretty excited if im working on something or developing something so i tend to overlook the time sometime but other than that you know when i when im out im out thats it well uh i guess ill be a little bit uh uh try and figure out how im gonna get sleep you know as soon as i can to make up xxx but um uh i i try not to be uh grumpy or anything i just probably feel a little bit tired mm i feel okay now uh changes like what mm well i i i see a more hopeful future you know and i see uh i see a lot of new things unfolding i mean from that perspective yes no never uh i feel okay now uh i went to a great party last week that was really cool yeah well it was like on a rooftop uh and a a lot to really uh nice people who are basically in the same kind of uh mindset uh pursuing the same type of uh uh goals and it was uh quite inspiring actually and i got a lot of information and a lot of good connections were made mm awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome my ideal weekend is uh cooking my own food relaxing you know and if im in the mood for company you know i have friends and uh you know uh family members join me well id kinda like to put on more weight sometime but that doesnt seem to work i eat like crazy and nothing happen mm well you know i i think people in general sometime uh uh misread mis misread you you know if you kinda like uh if you look different or youre in i in a different type of a if a different set of things make you uh excited or youre into a different way of thinking um people tend to misjudge you you know and that used to make make me really be upset sometime but um yeah im ive kinda figured it out and im pretty much over that you know so i see it as their loss and not mine you know if they didnt get to know me you know thats hey maybe they dont need to and it doesnt really bother me ive kinda worked those things out in time you know yeah uh my best qualities probably um uh listening i think mumbling and uh maybe just uh talking uh you know on a conversational level uh yeah sometime people tend to burden me with everything they got because of that but uh you know i guess is thats probably one of the things that come with the turf so when i clears throat when i see too much of that i just uh pull back uh uh go for your dream believe in what youre doing dont let anyone discourage you and youll be okay and thats the way i feel now that its uh kind of evolved itself most proud of um i think my um my my my kinda spiritual relationship you know and my my my settleness about not being too too anxious about about bout things that go on around me and being able to see that you know there are no mistakes that really happen and you shouldnt really uh never allow yourself to be defeated im im proud to be able to have arrived at that point in my my my thinking my framework uh that i think that saved me a lot of uh problems that couldve been uh differently mumbles very good questions uh i bye bye

synch yes i am im doing very good today im originally from chicago illinois moved out here when i was three yes i never go back family issues it depends on what youre into if youre into um the fast life and hollywood it doesnt compare at all um if youre into the cold weather then you would rather be out there i i like the sun ill my mom and my dad split up laughter its okay i have no idea i was only three when i moved out here i like the sunshine i like the weather i like the balance of the weather we have in the spring winter fall and and and the summer i like the beaches i like hollywood i like that the lakers are here and and laughter i love um the people is its a different variety i think la is a microcosm of the united states people from all over the world come to the united states and people from all over the country and all over the world they come to la for a better opportunity so thats what i like about la oh gang violence laughter no not really ive traveled one time to arizona and one time to stockton california and another time to barstow california but i dont do much traveling right now mainly because of finances i studied alcohol and drug counseling i just felt it in my i just felt it in my heart that thats what i was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addictions so um that was a kinda easy choice i got some advice from people and i just went into it to do it just just to see what it was and i finished school and did a intership and got hired and so i believe thats what im supposed to be doing with my life im not working right now i actually moved away and i had to deep breath i was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so i actually had to give up that job um in order to make that move but since i came back down ive been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interviews so i can get back into counseling well it can be it can be very difficult at times because um i have a felony uh and and so i cant work with the youth and i cant work with the elderly and but the regular dopes i can and then you have to be certified and im not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even allow you to take the test you have to work a certain amount of hours so right now im just trying to get into um interns you know try to intern and show people what i can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen on my resume and um yeah they just want people to be certified um not being certified um the experience and the fact that i have a felony makes it hard laughter my dream job is to open my own facility um or or as an author you know that depends de that depends on on on people mainly i mainly adapt my personality to the people that im around if people are perky then im gonna be perky if theyre standoffish then i may seem shy but im not shy im just giving em their space and allowing them to decide when they wanna open up but if people open up right away then i open up right away laughter i i mainly listen to music or i watch youtube write poetry um or i just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like i can sing which i cant so laughter thats and another thing i do is i eat ice cream laughter controlling my temper im very very good at it it depends on what it is i have to say that last time i lost my temper it was because i felt like somebody was um scaring my mother so i lost my temper but ninety nine times out of hundred i dont lose my temper dont like to raise my voice and i just like to be calm and cool and i like everybody to be comfortable i dont want anybody to be frightened or anything theres no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it i just believe that and and i believe um angry outbursts to be a link to um heart problems and high blood pressure so i definitely dont want that well i was just telling you about um it was it was my mothers husband and to tell you the truth um i couldve handled that differently but when i seen the look in my mamas eyes of fear i just lost it and i snapped you know i told my mother uh like um i dont like this uh you need you need to take care of this because im dont know how long i can keep my composure as far as this cause ive been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but thats her husband and so i kept my distance in their relationship but when i saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me um that i dont like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so i shouldve just left i shouldve just left and then went home and rested and got up in the next morning went to church but um yeah it we had a big time explosion and that created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months so yeah those six nine months i cant get back yes well my brothers in prison um i havent seem him in twenty years hes been there twenty years my sister moved to chicago thirteen years ago i havent seen her since then so im only close to my mother and um my son i havent seen him in five years and im still looking for him and waiting for the day i see him again and how thats gonna turn out for me ive just you know i have small family and i have family in chicago but i dont mess around with that side of the family just just because um of what i seen and heard so i just dont want it to happen to me at all so i just keep my distance someone whos been a positive influence inf influence in my life i would say scrubbedentry taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me m  me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else and taught taught me how how to like monitor my emotions and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when theyre really strong thats when i just need to be quiet until that intense fizzling subsides and then i can speak rationally and not just emotionally um and of course um hes he was the one that encouraged enc told me that i should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor um he got twenty seven years clean and sober right now he used to live on skid row and he h the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something that ill never forget feel guilty about my grandfather um passed away in two thousand four and at that time i was just getting out of prison um two thousand two i was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he told me in so many words that he wasnt gonna be around for that much longer but i didnt get it cause i had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was crowded with things that i considered to be more important than that plus the fact i didnt understand him what he was saying but when he died i figured out that he was telling me that i should probably spend more time with him before its time for him to go but i couldnt see it then and i feel i think about it all the time something i can erase from my memory huh would be the day my brother hit my mom i always replay that over and over and over and over in my mind and its like thats one memory i just i can just go without replaying in my mind over and over and over and over and over again so yeah that day that memory right there i felt conflicting feelings because on one hand on one hand my brother was protecting me from getting beat and on the other hand he was hitting my mom so was kinda in the middle uh most nights i dont i go to sleep maybe three in the morning and im probably prob im more than likely up at seven in the morning so i dont get much sleep it it depends it depends on the environment im in um if i dont sleep well im going eventually im gonna be irritable but it doesnt happen right away it depends on my environment and whos around me if there are difficult people thats gonna be a challenge for me and um if people are easygoing no one will even know that i didnt get much sleep how i been feeling lately i just been feeling like that things are about to start going better for me um making some better decisions um taking advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people that can um open the right doors for me so im very enthusiastic about that even if it doesnt happen ill send out a million resumes i dont care if i get five interviews im i will never stop because i know know that being a counselor is my life mission and and um im also destined to be a writer and its just a matter of time before my book is out there and people um know about me because ive had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and i have a lot to offer humanity so its just a matter of time before um the that the public is exposed to what um ive been gathering my behavior im more mellow um i laugh more more humorous i let a lot of things go that i used to just let tick me off and anger me and things that i cant control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people dont betray me and mm you y you just cant control that i think i matured mentally and psychologically eh and the um acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me so i know my thoughts have changed and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed i still have to monitor it um my thoughts and my behavior i still have to monitor them but overall im you know um back then i just tolerated myself now i um actually like myself and um it will behoove beh behoove you to feel the same way no no i havent no last time i felt happy was last night cause the lakers won the basketball game laughter yeah my best friend would describe me um he calls me the truth because i always tell the truth and people try to hide stuff and i always reveal it they cant hide it from me um i have a statement that says i see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it and i see stuff days and months before they start happening i i know human behavior when i see it and i sniff it out real well and its just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth um because of how i interact with people and how people um have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that i see through them like i said like a clear glass with nothing in it and yes thats why he calls me the truth laughter um i wish i wouldve never well obviously i wish i wouldve never went to prison um i wish that i could change well um my economic status my employment status and um my teeth thats like a problem area for me i did a lot of stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and i didnt take care of my teeth and now that i need to be um confident about myself as i can be you know it always comes up every now and then you know the thought like i wonder if they looking at my teeth i wonder if theyre looking at my teeth i never get the sign si i never get the impression that they are but in the back of my mind theres these thoughts that says are they looking at my teeth so i would really change that and i would change my physical um size i think i would like to be at least thirty five pounds heavier but im working on it twenty years ago which would make me eighteen i wouldve at that time i was a big time um high school basketball player for fremont high school and i had colleges coming to see me and i wouldve given myself the opportunity was to stay away from the troublemakers because i didnt and i blew my opportunity to play college basketball for duke blue devils and who knows i couldve been playing for the lakers last night but hey im most proud of the fact that you know what im most proud of my mom really really um she graduated from school she had a fulltime job she had a fulltime job um she would wake up at five in the morning go to work get off her job at three thirty go straight to the college leave the college at nine oclock at night she does this five days a week and still had the strength to maintain um she was on the deans list and the presidents list so doing all of this you know when they say xxx that older people cant do things i i just think that dispels that rumor um and she recently got her um license as a evangelist in the church so im just real proud of that and um her life has been affecting people in a in a positive way so yeah my mom laughter okay

going into business i like what the it entitles about i wanna have my own business either making web pages just be able to be free and dont being relying on someone else just be able to have freedom for myself outgoing well i just like to you know be around people like to get to know people and depending on the person how i feel around em i like to hear music or you know do do different things like play sports or do different things just to unwind well im getting better at it you know i xxx well it was like uh two days ago it was something about uh i needed to pay a bill or something some something that uh i you know i had taken care of but the person hes like more picky about it you know hes more you know how how girls are you know they they want everything right there and then i have it handled you know i have it everything there and they just bugging sometimes they dont give you the space that you need to resolve something well i felt like i was overwhelmed i already had it resolved i just was waiting for a check you know thats not on my control but i already had made the paper proper arrangements and shes bugging me about it and its like youre making you know an argument you know a storm in a glass of water its like mhm well uh differently theres couple of them but not so recently because ive been more trying to get my life together but the decisions i made before in the past like dropping out of school and doing other different things mm guilty not that much because not really not that i could think right off the top of my head the hardest decision oh its just not on top of my head right now an event mm well the only things that i remember is when i black out or different things like that that i dont remember but not nothing like a particular only when my uh brothers died and different things like that mhm well my brother was in gangs and different things and he was getting more into trouble and its just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about that much get into it no im hispanic i you know i like to be with my family and you know i i like to go over there to mexico too i have a halfsister and my grandpa died he was over there in mexico so i do uh like to have a good relationship with my family well my mom and dad they always work hard they always done what they had to do to pay the bills thats why sometimes i be like you know running around trying to get everythings done but done correctly not trying to take the easy way out its a little hard because there eh especially here in los angeles theres a lotta different things that you could get into thats not that positive and its hard to stay focused on you know the correct stuff well normally i just knock out its not that hard its like it takes me like half an hour or fifteen minutes but uh sometimes i cant even wake up even with the alarm uh they have to wake me up you know my girl has to wake me up even with the alarm going on its like so hard so you know i just knock out i do get a little either im angry or i dont feel good and im not filled with energy but i still have to know i know i have to do something so i still go through with it i been well i been uh feeling good you know been a little restless but not that much i had to do stuff so i just you know put myself to do it no matter how i feel no nothing out of the ordinary no no the last time i felt happy that was probably on the weekend that i was you know going out with a going out have some fun and you know i was drinking and just relaxing and winding win winding down mhm my ideal weekend is usually with my girl either out or at home just relax but nothing else you know just be able to relax and unwind with her you know either going out somewhere to a nice place or staying at home but without getting any calls or xxx interruptions you know just be able to turn off the phone and turn off everything just be with her doing the other different things mhm uh like an outgoing guy you know very social but at the same time im reserved depending how i feel with people have to you know build trust or feel comfortable with them oh im changing a lot you know like uh my temper and different things drinking things im changing a little different things so i could get more different things done oh theres several but mostly uh is when im coming from mexico that they wanna demeander you even down there it feels uh like silly because i went to a store i was regularly dressed and i was telling em i wanted to buy something and then they said that that i i wasnt belong there and i and as soon as they saw my credit card they kinda changed perspective because they saw the wells fargo logo they know i was american but they thought it was like you know it it was wa it felt me it felt ridiculous to me because you go to a place and you have the money you ask for something youre gonna ask for something because you have it not just to waste wa kill their time just because they saw a logo of a card thats how they you know it just it was ridiculous for me no basically uh to stay more focused on different things uh stay in school and you know dont go you know try to control my temper and do different things because if i knew what i know now back then itd be different well uh i did drop out but i did uh go back to school and i you know i did get my high school and right now im in the process of doing other different things so right now is uh getting my high school getting that together and right now im working to another goal trying to get you know my either going back to school so its basically ba basically getting back to school and finishing the high school the ged mhm okay youre welcome bye
synch mm yes mm im doing pretty good uh i was born in los angeles mhm um i like the diversity of the city all the attractions and things that you can see um the food restaurants things like that traffic freeways crime mm uh yes i do mhm um seeing new places or going back and seeing same places and just enjoying relaxing getting away from la uh well lets see last trip i made was up to the central coast up in uh cambria and pismo beach area and um solvang santa ynez uh huh yeah probably uh when i got to study abroad in madrid spain when i was a student at ucla uh huh in terms of travel uh yeah i was um i participated in the uh education abroad program at ucla where you go live in another country to learn the language and you live there for a year at the university univers and you study at the university and uh it it was just a memorable year something someth an experience that i would never laughter forget thanks probably more shy but uh sometimes i could be outgoing um im more shy in terms of you know i it takes me it takes time t time for me to get to know people i mean im not a real party person i dont like to go to parties and meet people and things like that but if i if im among friends and things like that then i can be pretty outgoing with people i know laughter laughter laughter um drink wine um yeah drink wine maybe listen to some uh nice music pretty good i can im pretty good at controlling my emotions oh gosh um i wouldnt say it was a real argument it was more like a what just a discussion maybe about finances maybe money um just oh just a little irritated laughter but um not really not really strong emotional uh wow gosh i laughter i cant think of anything at the moment so uh lets uh skip that one um mm maybe uh eating eating more junk food than i admit to or the hardest decision i ever had to make uh maybe uh buying a home h buying a home or remodeling the home spending money for uh i it was um i felt it was time to move on with my life and uh to uh buy a place for myself so i could be selfsufficient and independent xxx yes very happy thank you uh an event i could erase from my uh when i um yeah when i was a student stud when i was a student teaching for a year trying to get my teaching credential and discovered i never enjoyed it i wanna erase that whole year nineteen eighty three uh it just brought back horrible laughter it just brings back laughter horrible memories of uh what i went through when i was student teaching and uh discovered that that teaching k twelve was not was w not for me i studied stud my major was spanish and linguistics i was very good at foreign languages and i thought um i enjoyed taking them and i was just having a good time taking foreign language and uh i was getting good grades so i thought maybe this is what i should go into foreign languages uh i was teaching teachi i was an adult ed teacher teaching english as a second language for thirty years and i just recently uh decided to uh retire myself um i have a pretty good relationship with my family with my mother and my sisters my father passed away in two thousand eight and um uh my relationship with my father wasnt as good as with my other family members yeah but uh on the xxx on the whole um we have pretty good relation with the rest of my family now um pretty easy i dont have any problems um if i dont sleep well im i may be moving around in the bed and you know um messing up the sheets but that doesnt happen too often oh pretty good i think ive been feeling pretty good no major health problems or anything no no no uh last time i was really happy uh probably uh when spring break came around it was uh vacation time and it was time to uh laughter go on our trip uh yeah it was um it was a week trip up to central coast to uh cambria and pismo beach and santa ynez it was just a nice getaway relaxing on the uh laughter hotel lawn and garden drinking wine and uh enjoying different sights and eating good food and laughter and buying wine to replenish our dwindling supply at home laughter thanks uh i think she would describe me as um eh kind and sweet and um motivated and uh just a nice person oh id say sometimes i wouldnt mind being a little more outgoing i guess i tend to be more reserved so i wouldnt mind being more outgoing towards strangers and things but mm uh really badly about myself uh lets see probably when i betrayed a confidence with some friends of mine when i uh taped them when i taped them singing christmas carols and i i played it to some other people and they found out and they really laid a guilt trip on me for doing that yeah but uh it all it all got resolved at the end we all laughter we became beca we were all laughter it was just a bad misunderstanding on my part but it worked out okay yeah um probably having done what i did by laughter playing it to other people uh what advice would i give myself ten or twenty years ago um uh dont give up just uh keep uh laughter keep pursuing what you want and uh never never give up xxx see it as a and as a disappointment if nothing noth if it doesnt work out um im a im a good listener um im a im a motivated person im hardworking im conscientious im caring um im generally a pretty happy type person something recently what i really enjoyed uh going to the uh going to the festival of books at usc this weekend uh yeah uh the festival of books is a its a festival where they have all these uh book mm book authors auth authors and they have demonstrations dem food demostrations and seminars and all kinds of books available to look at and uh theres uh lots of food and um and a lot of uh authors signing books and things uh its a great event for laughter just to laughter get out and and it was nice weather too so it was nice to be out there mhm yeah i really enjoyed that especially the food thanks most proud of um most proud of uh probably uh being successful in my work uh in my life in my marriage and just um yeah just basically being happy with myself oh youre welcome bye
synch yes im doing pretty good i was born and raised right here in los angeles sigh um the weather um would be number one i also like the diverse uh cultures i like the fact that theres a lot of different things here you can do and theres a lot of opportunity here um not just for myself but for my kids and um i think its really a great place to be when youre trying to establish a career go to school um learn about different people the traffic the cost of living um sometimes i think its too big and i think the transportation system as far as the bus and trains um is long overdue they need to revamp it or you know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation i travel when i can a little bit here and there i have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years so ive just traveled domestically i try to take at least one trip a year somewhere i just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places um going particularly somewhere ive never been and learning about that place you know like so if im going to dc i really look forward to it cause its a historic city you know things like that um my most recent trip wouldve been dc laughter last year um i went to go visit a friend and i stayed about three thr i think three to four days and i got to see the capitol um he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the white house the capitol building um i got to see a lot of other different uh government buildings and um it was it was a a good experience the irony was i had to fly on nine eleven and so that had me a little uneasy but once i was in the plane up in the air i was okay and it was all good and once i was back home i was like yes but i i i miss the trip and i look forward to going back um attending uh my friends wedding she had a destination wedding in hawaii um actually maui that was actually two three three years ago three years ago in august and um ive been trying to get back ever since and i wanna take my kids and i just love it there and i actually kinda look forward to to moving there one day um i have three sons um thirteenyearold twins boys and my youngest is also a boy hes eight they um all have birthdays in june the twins are june ninth and my baby is june fourth and so theyre just a few days apart but five years apart technically and theyre just super super typical boys active all over the place hormones puberty um so its actually an interesting time because you know the the two older boys are going through puberty um theyre teenage years um my youngest um still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of eight to nine years old so hell be nine in june and then my oldest will be fourteen so its a challenging time for me as well just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent every day and seeing how just with love and nurturing and um the right and you know well i cant say proper development but just with you know love and nurturing how a um baby grows into a toddler into you know a young boy to a teenager and then into a young man and so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and seeing how they have developed and you know seeing some of the things that theyre going through now that so reminiscent of my teenage years and um its just its very rewarding and um actually i look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when theyre older and off in college cause i really love children and giving back um mm theres probably a couple of things but i would just say um for me being a single parent is um the financial um well i would say that along with some of the emotional with w with them having um to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing um you know the just the everyday things of what you have to deal with the uh sometimes when youre just tired you dont wanna be bothered or youre trying to do things for yourself you have to be reminded that oh okay i gotta cook or i have to go pick my son up or i have to take him to baseball practice uh this one want to go over here um this one is acting moody and you know just those those types of challenges um as well as the financial and you know making sure you know youre able to put food on the table youre paying your rent and you know youre keeping up with the day to day and thats those two are probably the hardest things um for me to deal with well i just um i take it day by day i just put one foot in front of the other and um im extremely spiritual so i just rely on god and pray a lot and meditate um if i see i need a little help if if you know im im im not above asking for help so sometimes if i have to reach out to people or you know see what other resources are out there to help me you know i try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better um economic situation so i can continue to provide for them comfortably um i studied communications actually i was a um journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now im studying business laughter i just thought that you know um there would be more opportunities for me with business um as far as jobs and then i you know have a desire to go to graduate school so i just figured in the long run it was a better um it would put me in a better position give me more opportunities um with the communications its a little limited and especially as you get older um the fields of tv reporting and things like that um are kinda become you know harder to obtain so i just thought eh i would go into something more realistic and um you know but uh i like both fields i really do i like communicating writing reading talking as you can tell and um so well see um laughter a couple probably but i would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer um going to different destinations um trying different foods out um writing about different people cultures um learning and living you know uh about those different people and cultures living l living amongst am amongst the you know the the people there and um being interactive with the children and stuff like that so i kinda hope to be able to do that one day but yes um it it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor social worker something in that area if i could encompass all three hopefully i can i i would like to do that um thats actually a hard question probably because i initially grew up very shy and um not so much shy as i am reserved now um but not conservative but just reserved and you know when i go somewhere im checking everything everybody else out and then once i become comfortable or acclimate to the situation then im like okay you know i warm up to the to the situation or the people but im also friendly i can be very friendly and outgoing i like to talk um you know i seem like a chatterbox but im not really so usually if im in a big space with a whole lot of people i dont like to be the center of attention atten attention i can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but i i overall i am a open friendly person laughter um for me um it it could be something as simple as just unplugging everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating praying or reading a good spiritual scripture um if im able to i like to go for a good massage maybe get a facial um you know things that will i kinda like the physical part part of it i like massages things that really release tension um and if not then just like i said just sitting at home reading and praying or i like the beach i love the beach so sometimes i drive and go sit by the beach i like li also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself or get a mani pedi or maybe go window shopping you know things like that mm pretty good sometimes im just like grr i dont really have so much a issue with the temper as i am i just im more impatient unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations so i just can become really irritated or irritable um quite agitated especially if its that time of the month for me i just lose patience um outside of that im actually pretty good i try to be very you know conscious of where im at and be very patient with people especially if i could see that the person is like if if theyre a new n a new checkout person at the the counter or cashier i do try to be i do try to be patient and understanding cause i would want that you know if it were me i would want someone to extend that to me um you know with my kids sometimes you know its this it works both ways too once its that time of the month im just like ugh just leave me alone um or i might have a short temper or a short fuse so i am conscious of it i try to be aware of it and and try to monitor it but you know like anybody im human and there are times or i have my days or moments when i could just like ugh go off and just lose it um sigh well i havent really had it not per se an argument but theres been a ongoing thing with american express so i would say because it was not a personal contact but a company i eh we it it really was an argument but uh you know i i had some um issues with american express i had to call in about on i think saturday and i kept um i wasnt getting the response i expected and so i would get the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and i was upset and you know the rep was trying to overtalk me then i was trying to overtalk her so you y you know i dont know if you would consider that an argument but i would definitely say thats the last time when you know i just kinda like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and eh that th that was the closest you know to an argument and then i had to call back this morning that one didnt really escalate to an argument but it was um a a a tense exchange for a minute or two probably the most recent contact and that wouldve been the one on saturday with american express um or actually it was on sunday yeah and um i know the person was trying to help me but you know when you youre constantly being told different things and ive had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved it just takes you there so um just i kept raising my voice said some things i shouldnt had um and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact i like to really feel in control of the contact and so um it just took me there my blood pressure was raised clears throat excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe thirty minutes or an hour after that just irritable and agitated and upset and and so i always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how i could you know handle things differently but thats one i i definitely wish i couldve kept my cool and been more levelheaded and and not really raised my voice and you know um been more polite sigh mm well ive probably have had a couple but clears throat probably the most is a situation years ago when i just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two and i was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and um it just was not a good time and he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time and um i wasnt comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but he put me under so much stress and you know kind of i wanna say really pushed me into having terminating the the pregnancy and thats always stayed with me and ive always missed that pregnancy that child i think about that that baby or what couldve been i try not to hold any um anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it but i know deep down inside secretly if i had it to do all over again i wouldve just i wouldve kept the baby and moved forward so that wouldve been probably the hardest especially emotionally i could deal with a lot and i have dealt with a lot you know um being unemployed or you know lot of financial problems but that to me was the hardest thank you no mm mm no um okay you know um i was laid off in december so ive been constantly trying to do things to you know get um back on my feet so thats been a little tough ive had ive had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school so i my m my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off you know in the same place um about five years ago well shes been able to move forward and um go on with her life and now shes graduating in next month from usc with her masters in social work so im feeling a little envious of that and i have been for like the past year but more so recently although ive very very happy for her you know and shes a good person and she deserves it but xxx of course deep down inside i wish it was me so that too has kinda been bothering me well im really good with um people i communicate well i like to talk im really good with children thats why i would like to teach or be a counselor um although i havent not really tapped into it i know im a very creative person um i know i write pretty good um i could possibly be a creative writer but i know im very creative so if given the opportunity i know i could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with maybe songwriting um fiction writing um but probably like interior decorating anything artistic just anything cause i love music i love the arts i love drama i love plays um im not a big fashion buff but i do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so um i think those would are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people i know i would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time i have a good ear for listening im a great mediator and i know how to because ive been through a lot and one of my friends called me the voice of reason the one thats actually graduating from sc but um i know im like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i dont know if it has to do with you know having older parents myself or how i grew up or i had i had very traditional southern parents um who instilled a lot of great values in me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign im a pisces but um im im really good with people just you know period you know like i said i have my moments but i i know if it if its something i could go into and develop i would do well mm not really some of the situations um i wish i wouldve waited to maybe have gotten married before i had children um picked a different partner um and i say that i mean my sons father is great but um a great father for my kids but not so much as a partner for me were not together we havent been together in years but im just saying overall i think um had i yeah i think i would say if i could let me backtrack that say not finishing school when i should have and not following my my dreams and goals and doing things as i kinda was planning initially and i think thats that would i honestly be the one thing i could say i regret is not following my goals and and finishing school on time and and pursuing what i really wanted to do stay focused and finish school and pick a career path and stay on that and stay motivated and dont let anything or anybody deter you mm um i think im pretty stable and consistent just with overall i think um how i face adversity how i face f i face things you know um i am a pretty committed person i try to you know if i say imma do something i try to stick to it im a very loyal friend um and um im proud of the fact that ive ive maintained and done a pretty good job with raising my kids solo okay great thank you bye bye
synch yes im doing fine im from los angeles and born in los angeles yes uh you have a lot of places to go a lot of people to see a lot of things to do smog uh the environmental has changed over the years uh xxx ive been around since nineteen fifty two and i was born here in los angeles and i see such changes as far as environmental with the smog and mm basically thats about it ive been to several s uh several places in the united states yes uh trying different type of cuisines uh i like to go to museum like the historical im a historical buff i um just uh going somewhere different than uh where ive been here all my life uh let me start with uh well try boston i had never been to boston before and when i went um i was able to look at the historical uh the buildings and i went to um uh i saw um um eh the lake charles and the and the boats and stuff and it it was just it was a good experience and um theres another place i went to i took a ferry and it and i my mind went on blank on it um god i cant even think of it right now um but other than that uh new orleans ive been to new orleans i didnt go to the mardi gras its just i dont like to go and it uh to mardi gras when they have a lot of people um i just went on a off season uh i enjoyed that and ive been to atlanta georgia and i have taken a cruise uh ive went to the caribbeans and i took the mexico cruise uh i my next cruise id like to go to is alaska because i want to be able to see uh certain areas that we havent destroyed yet as far as the environmental um im outgoing as far as uh going places i dont have a problem um eating alone um i dont have a problem meeting people um im only shy in conversing back and forth to a stranger laughter oh i have a favorite thing uh i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes im a a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and ive been very successful since i was a kid ive won a lot of sweepstakes and uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just eh im so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter em i usually try to enter em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so its been successful for me um getting married and having my children laughter mm i have a twentysevenyearold son and i have a thirtyoneyearold son um both of em uh well one of ems married the other ones not and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance co a property conveyance conveyance examiner and the other one is a computer engineer so and ive been married for thirty three years and um basically uh marriage pretty strong you know what if you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them and talk to em and find out whats going on and tell em that you love them uh my son ive taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you and even today when theyll call me and hang up they say mom i love you you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door that you care and uh i ive never had to go to t to t eh to any jail to get em out um theyve been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble and im very proud of that especially with boys i dont know how it wouldve been with a girls maybe a little different but laughter with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you and um ive watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son and its it seems like hes learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey i got a wife i have a son and its my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads so it pays off and i i basically he treats her well um my mother was more stricter on me laughter uh my my my parents um for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i were the girls they they werent strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls so they didnt let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they werent type that liked to travel and i used to look at them and say no im not gonna be like them im gonna travel im not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean me theres nothing wrong with em because they found love at home laughter and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh im gonna go here im going to go there but she never did she died she never did do d do any travel so ive made up for her and uh i i want to do something different and thats to to travel more than and be more out there i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly so i made up for it i think before i speak and then i am the type of person also to um i take on other peoples feelings before i um blurt out the wrong thing i try to uh analyze the situation first before bef because sometimes you can put your yo open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of um laughter its probably something about my husband did laughter oh he h i know what it was its about uh well probably over some construction cons new construction that my husband is working on on our house uh we had a disagreement on that um men have their own way of doing things and um i had told him not to use a certain uh eh person to work on our house but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead and now he sees all the downfalls and he didnt listen and so i didnt say i told you so but i guess he can tell by my facial expression that uh he hed have done wrong and i told him i said look youre losing money and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now cause he knows he has done wrong and uh but he doesnt wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesnt wanna really face the fact so he says look its my project no its our project so uh eh that thats one of the biggest arguments what were having right now um that i can think of thats recent i felt that he h he h he didnt really listen to me and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways cause i told him that um you need to do your research im the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my is and cross my ts but my husband hes not like that hes like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money and hes a good friend of mine so i dont care i mean is he licensed he doesnt look at all that stuff hes he just jumps into it laughter which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because it was just wasted money that we couldve saved cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again and it didnt make any sense um i retired early um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because id been working since i was eighteen and i had like thirty one and a half years of service and what was so nice about it that only needed n needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i dont know if youre familiar with calpirg but um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long um i didnt get the full percentage i shouldve stayed til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didnt get the full amount but thats okay um eh i i found myself going back doing a little parttime job because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis laughter so um i think that was the kind of mistake i did i shouldve kinda waited til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up and i dont i pay very little money so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive um let me see the hardest its probably when my mom died cause uh im not used to anybody dying and my mother um died in ninety nine of uh nonhodgkin lymphoma and i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility responsi because i am the eldest it was put in me and im like oh my god what do i do xxx and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didnt have hers organized and i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff and unfortunately my mom laughter this is interesting she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didnt die of course with with accident she had a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything yeah it was it was but and now i can handle i i i um laughter this will sound weird but um since that ive learned from that so i have made it available for my children that my husband and i we got together and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um what do you call the um barrel insurance we had that and it just weve had it for mm many many years so its almost paid but xxx ten years itll pay for everything um the plot and everything and uh another thing that i did ive even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird so my son make one phone call thats it i dont want them to go through what i went through and my husband agreed thats the one thing we did agree on and um he said he dont want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling em what to do its already written we did a living trust i mean its nothing they can do but make one phone call and thats it i have no problem sleeping i sleep very laughter well pretty good um ive been a little tired but thats only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so its more physical but not in the mental um exercise walk walking more so no not really no no im basically happily all the time im mm more so im making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um thanks and then they ill ill follow up on em and see how theyre doing oh uh resource person ive been um described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends because im the type of person i research everything i get into just about i just dont  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother im never gonna give up my thomas brothers map yellow pages youd be surprised i dont give up my yellow pages so theres certain little things that i dont really let go i know we have technology but sometimes you know youd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology gives gi you have it right at your finger but you can find things and and they say im more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it and that gives me satisfaction uh i wish i can uh um stop going up and down on my weight laughter ill lose weight ill go on this big diet before the summertime and and then by christmas time im i have a what they call a yoyo weight problem and if i can stop binging and making food my friend um i think thats just a nervous disorder i just ju i like to eat and um but also i dont like to be overweight either cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and i cant get em xxx on right now so i know i say if im gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so its mm mostly uh not happy with my weight thats it yeah im sorry didnt hear you um no not really i regret laughter that i cant stay skinny laughter i cant lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on um lets see xxx ten or twenty years ago mm i wouldve saved a little bit more money before i retired laughter and uh xxx uh basically um putting away more money before i retire instead of retiring too early most proudest is of my life um meeting a lot of people that came in my life uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion and here all fifteen of us with exception of one were all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh its basically keeping the same friends i think eh were gonna probably outlive each other laughter okay youre welcome bye bye
sync yes im okay thank you um i was born in east los angeles and yes um the freedom to explore outdoors and with different um weather temperature temp you know with weather clears throat temperature and climates to go skiing or to the beach maybe in the same day i like that um mm i think probably the overcrowding um and the smog mm not not frequently but i have meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures sure um the last trip ive taken outside of here was to italy and um that was my second time being there and i enjoyed it more this time because um i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and um and i was better prepared for italians and their culture i felt i wasnt as uh you know i was just better prepared i thought for that trip um clears throat that would be um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the midst of acres and acres and acres of grapes was just magnificent um human development um clears throat i actually didnt decide at first to do that i started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and um i went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time t and i miss i had a family so i had to make a different diff a career choice quickly and um so the college offered human development as a major and i um just went right in and used my used u used my units that i had already acquired towards that particular major and and im happy with it um currently no i stay at home i have a little one uh well hes not so little im preparing to go back to work um in the meantime i design jewelry well i have three children um i have a almost four year old and then i have two older children seventeen and twenty three no um that your children the the love sigh from them and for them is unconditional all the stages that they go through theyre stages all the time for every age laughter and then everybody in my household is all different because theyre different ages so um i think im probably more in tune with those different stages thats why it makes me crazy um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents it was just kinda like you know is she fed is she dressed she has a house i mean a roof over her head and were doing great as parents and we love her and so it wasnt um there wasnt too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know theres books for every age every year month you know clears throat and um so i think it difference differs in that way tremendously very close clears throat outgoing mm i dont i dont um feel uninhibited u uninhibited i feel a little you know confident to talk to people i probably talk more than i need to laughter um clears throat i bead i clears throat do i design jewelry thats what i do to relax im pretty good i i well i think i um try not to not to um feel or let others know what my emotions are when im upset um which is not good cause if i dont do anything with them then i know that at some point its gonna come out and um yeah that thats uh something i have to work on like exercising or something um clears throat it was my husband and it was about um he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him uh really tired of talking about that same topic um well it came it spawned from f from a client of my husbands whos a female and she shared with him that shed been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and um clears throat and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me think about cheating and he knows that ive been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating clears throat and um sigh i weve had this conversation a lot of times and uh i mean not just that but i dont know just about cheating in general and um so i just said what i normally said normally say is that i havent um cheated and that i did think about that when we were first together and uh but it was just a mere thought and um and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just kinda sigh i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that and i just started thinking you know were having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation laughter are you the one thats cheating and so thats how that that went into that um argument i mean it wasnt ayelling y yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting um sigh not talking at all laughter um sigh mm pretty much any situation that involves my children and if ive yelled because i really dont like if i came to the point where ive had more of yelled it bothers me because um i was yelled at a lot and i just feel bad about that and i try really hard to not handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get and result in in yelling hmm that would probably be whether to keep a pregnancy or not yeah yeah i um i was just talking about it yesterday actually and um oh i was pregnant and i had wanted i wasnt married yet and i had wanted to be married and but i just didnt think that i it was the right time for me and um i had pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy but i made the decision by myself and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me and so that decision was quite hard because i felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and drops microphone oops and uh this is on correctly um hang on this ear piece is falling there we go that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no i wouldnt say thats the hardest decision i ever had to make im sorry the hardest decision that i had to make in my life was whether or not clears throat um the hospital should um unplug the life or um life support machine for my father or not that was the hardest decision um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been um to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself um was beyond it who he was and i just couldnt see him like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told so i agreed to um resort that not hardly ever laughter too many things running on my mind um and pretty much um mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends uh even though i know that theyre gonna come co i mean im constantly worried about uh how they are when they come home and so i really cant fall asleep on the weekends most of the time but um and you

ive in the process of changing therapists so its been about because the program that i was in um lost funding and i lost my therapist or the therapist that i was working with and so its been about two months maybe three now and um but i did notice when i was in therapy um that it was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist um it really helped me cope um sigh when i picked up my son laughter up from um when he was released from um jail um a go getter uh probably you know uh she would use the term hustler but meaning that ill im not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know legally of course um outgoing um maybe sometimes a little too for too outgoing for her um and compassionate sensitive loyal mm all the things that remind me of my mother laughter well yelling the yelling part was one um just j just the little things that used to drive me so crazy i see s can see myself doing them and it bothers me a lot regarding what mm clears throat um not too much really i dont know clears throat to go to college right after high school and not wait um and sigh that i didnt really need to be in a relationship to be happy or that you dont have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and live life um what did i do mm i

opportunities uh and the weather laughter yes sigh it took a minute uh had to adjust to tisk the uh different attitudes of the people the surroundings the locations and the vast area that someone had to cover to get to one spot to another um well the weather uh for one the never end uh uh uh it never snows in in southern california uh two uh the prospects of uh uh starting out a business or becoming uh selfemployed and doing what i like to do the people theyre not friendly for no no ones friendly out here you know uh back east and im from uh i was raised in the south where everybody is uh cordial friendly hi when you pass in the streets out here people think that you have uh uh some agenda just for saying hello in passing so thats what i dont like about la used to uh i used to be on the road a lot i was a a truck driver and plus uh a entertainment uh coach driver for several uh motown bands back in the day so yeah so im used to traveling yes yeah well this is a beautiful beau this is actually a beautiful country so just viewing uh uh the countryside uh visiting different towns different cultures uh different towns uh and seeing how basically how the rest of the uh the country uh uh lives uh some not so good some bad uh and some good um lets see denver colorado i lived in denver for a couple years which is uh really a great uh uh city uh and then i lived in uh atlanta which is uh uh really a great state where is you know you have the southern attitude a a southern attitude southern attitude which is everybodys friendly and gets along and and lets see ive been back and forth across this country at least sixteen to twenty times so yeah its its been its been its been an adventure laughter uh arkansas little rock where i had to get into a uh you might

the rebels uh not rebels but uh what were they uh confederates they still have this uh uh tendency of thinking blacks or any other culture besides whites arent uh valuable people yeah so it i had a incident down there where it actually turned into a shoot out but im okay a little of both it it depends on it depends on the time on the period it depends on what mood im in at the time you know i can be outgoing cause i do uh like to go to  nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and i know like i said i uh i did some entertainment before so at clubs im more outgoing in social events more shy laughter meditate very good very good because uh if i let my temper get the best of me i uh tend to um cause more harm than good you know uh harm to the person harm to myself by you know uh physical altercations or um going to jail and so yeah im very good at uh controlling my emotions my temper good question uh okay girlfriend laughter uh we just recently broke up about two three weeks ago because of a argument about what she thought she could do and what i know she couldnt do and she wanted to do it anyway so uh that led to a argument and the argument ended in us breaking up so yeah it was emotional uh but um im fifty five and its not my first break up so i just take it in stride and and move on uh well its its probably its no one no no situation actually can be i feel uh at the time when you when you deal with a situation at any particular time theres probably always a better way to handle it after the fact but uh i would say back in the day back in the eighties when me and my  wife broke up i think i couldve handled that one better because i was younger more hot tempered and more irrational so i couldve handled that one better yes what the uh uh the way i broke the way i handled that situation well like i said uh being young and and inexperienced and and emotions and and attitudes and uh not being able to communicate with another person on the level of of understanding laughter hmm leaving home well it was like sigh what can i say it was about one oclock two oclock in the morning and i just decided to pack up and and and leave  uh without letting

i love being able to do so many different things um and i go to the beach a lot um i still go up to the mountains i go camping all the time um so i i love it i love it always opportunities laughter um i have traveled quite a bit i was in the peace corps and i was um tisk in south america i was in paraguay for three years and i traveled all through south america brazil peru uh peru chile bolivia um i also spent a year in london traveled all through europe and i used to go to canada often uh id love to get to asia one of these days uh meeting new people the food i love trying new food um and just getting a different perspective on the world and different peoples um outlook on the world and because america tends to become isolated um i hiked the inca trail when i was in um uh peru and that was a five day hike starting out of cusco um we hiked for um i think what four or five days um and woke up one the last morning at the sun gate of machu picchu and that was just an most amazing experience cause i would only id id seen about id seen it in national geographic you know all my life um so to be there and experience that was phenomenal philosophy i have my degree in philosophy i minored in art clears throat well i started out in business and i got very disenchanted with it very quickly and so i decided to study what i wanted to study while i was in college and had the opportunity so thats what i wanted to do and everyone advised me against it because you cant get a job as a philosopher um but i had the idea of getting my philosophy degree then going to law school and being a professor of ethics um but that kind of fell apart and thats actually how i ended up joining the peace corps laughter so it all worked out im sorry yeah mhm im im sorry my alarms going off on my phone itll die in a second okay im sorry its still going sorry i turned off the phone but i forgot to turn off the alarm that should go okay what im sorry what was your question my dream job um sigh  gosh

the alarm is like laughter its like i forgot its my alarm to go to yoga class im terribly sorry about that laughter okay laughter laughter sorry for the interruption um i have a actual fish tank um at my house and i i do the the same thing and i do that with my children when they get upset um the i sit them in front of the fish tank and its very relaxing um i also try and meditate um i try and and just sit down and be quiet um and gather my thoughts um i like to read and um or sometimes i i walk or ill take my dog for a walk sigh i wish i could say i was good at it but usually i um i tend to have outbursts every once in a while um when things are getting too chaotic at my house um and im feeling very underappreciated i will have a burst of anger yeah my husband doesnt appreciate that um and i i ive never done it at work or in a social situation but at home with my family ive done it and then instead of um recognizing that im upset about it my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad and then that escalates and uh sometimes i just end up walking out the door or going to my room hmm im sorry um i i usually after i have an outburst and i isolate myself for a little bit i can come back relaxed and deal with the situation in a more calm manner um sometimes its very hard but i i ive gotten to the point where i know just to stop and and get myself out of there and and go take some deep breaths um and then really try and figure out what im feeling why im being angry why why am i being um so tense and then be able to verbalize that um well i i it happens a few times when i start getting ive had a very tense day um and things havent gone right um i tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while im  making dinner and the kids are all home and theyre asking me questions about their homework or theyre turning on the tv or and my husbands uh uh bothering me about things that i just dont need to think about right then and one time i just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out just let me finish dinner and nobody would and i just it just had more pressure building up and building up and i actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove laughter really hard to just like get people to pay attention to what i was saying it actually made a dent in my stove laughter um which is still there um so that that i i should have um walked out sooner and taken my deep breaths before i did that um it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child um i wasnt married um tisk i had a very good friend um oh i was i was thirty two at the time so i was uh you know i wasnt young i think if i was younger i probably would have decided to have an abortion but at that point in my life im like okay im im going to have this um and i had um i i got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to um but wed only been dating like three months and i was living with a a good friend of mine who i had been in the peace corps with um and she and so i didnt know this guy very well um i didnt know if we could raise a child together i didnt know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else um and my friend suggested that we raise the child together um even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together um and uh so it was a lot of um huge decisions that were gonna determine the rest of my life um and i made the decision based on more common sense and practicality um but i dont regret that decision i think i made a good decision to marry my husband and raise our child laughter um theyre older now my uh my eldest is seventeen he is um tisk at da vinci science uh school and hes very much into engineering he is getting his pilots license uh which im very proud of him for um then my daughter is fifteen and she loves acting uh she um she has a boyfriend who um uh they see just once a week at church basically um and they text each other constantly um shes a very very typical fifteen year old and then i have a twelve year old he is extremely active laughter and is in constant motion and is always making noises but i love him dearly um he is into rock climbing and theres a rock climbing gym near our house so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis no i find it extremely difficult i dont i wasnt my mother had a very difficult d my dad died when i was young and um my mother kind of disconnected when that happened um so i didnt have a very warm or loving relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically raised myself i was um kind of on my own from a very young age um i mean she was at the house but really had no interaction with her so i really didnt have parenting skills that you know most people are are raised with um i know what not to do but sometimes its very difficult and um i i see my friends that have you know these very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know theyre making cookies and everythings organic and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect um and its like i im just not that person so i i i try and be im i i think i am a very good mother but im not um a typical mother i think im more um im more creative a lot of times i and we do a lot of things um but its not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing actually when we go camping its more im more homey when i go camping than i am at home i think im more tense when im at home but im trying to like through meditation and things of that sort im trying to become calmer and more patient i think my patience is what um i need to work on the most im a been an insomniac all my life i remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and um i havent slept well for a long time um but i realize that if i exercise and i do something with my brain intellectually during the day i have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well um and thats sometimes thats hard to do um and so a lot of times i stay s i stay awake reading ill read til midnight um and then ill try and go to sleep um and usually i wont get back up even if i ill wake up at three again and things of that sort but ill try to go back to sleep yesterday i didnt feel so good i was um i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather  and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday um cause i planned on planned on working on my garden and then im im building buil im making a butterfly garden in my front yard um so i had some more planting to do and i just couldnt didnt kind of feel like doing it um so i just sort of puddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but  today i feel really good so i feel more positive i feel more energy so no no um i dont know i just got a new mattress actually that hasnt really helped me sleep but um it was really good because i needed one for a really long time and it i was just kind of excited about being delivered deli it delivered and and set up and and that sounds like sort of mundane um but it was you know just like im finally doing something positive cause its its something that i put off doing and put off doing and put off doing and it was like finally uh there and concrete and its like okay ive done this task that i can check off my list um but also i took the kids camping over um spring break and uh we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and  um around the camp fire and making smores and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy laughter i dont know um i think she believes that im uh uh more intellectual and smarter than i think that i am at times so she comes to me with a lot of um issues uh she always she always solicits advice from me she thinks i give her good advice um and when she doesnt know what to do shell shell shell ask me um and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by uh or just like to complain about because im sympathetic um or empathetic and uh i just im just there to listen and i dont need to give her any advice so i think a a good listener and good advice giver i procrastinate a lot um i start projects and i dont finish them uh so thats what im working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that ive started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and um im very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and ill get almost finished and then i dont know what happens i just completely lose interest um sometimes i think its because im afraid to finish them which sounds a little strange but um i im working on that im trying to get those done oh gosh laughter um not following through on the opportunities i had when i got out of the peace p peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go into i couldve gone to get my masters degree um with on a grant and things of that sort um but instead i got pregnant and got married and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed um but then when i got pregnant the second time it was right at a time where i had to fight for a directorship and i realized my limitations where i i couldnt be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship and so i really wish so i resigned um and i wish i had stuck with that um cause then i would have a have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and solid career um not base decisions on emotions sometimes i um and not i ive had some really bad bosses um the jobs were wonderful um but my ego got in the way and i wouldve told myself to let go of that aspect of the job let go of the the egotistical reactions that i had to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well um my children actually um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal um and uh people are actually really interested in that and they were like an awe that they actually know someone who actually did that um so that thats im yeah i always when i was a little girl my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the peace corps when it first started and i always said oh i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day and then finally i got to the point where so id i either had to shut up or do it um so thats that was one of my prouder experiences okay thank you bye
synch yes i feel great i am from los angeles california um the weather the opportunity and the ocean its overcrowded overpriced and somewhat dirty i have well its nice to see other places in the world and to meet other people and cultures i worked on cruise ships as a musical entertainer and traveled to alaska the aleutian islands korea japan and the caribbean islands um being in galena alaska and being on a small airplane and traveling in a snow storm and surviving like i was on the edge of death and life but i lived the arts and business i dont know i was attracted to the arts at a young age and business went along with it yes yes to be able to entertain people and make them feel emotions and make enough money to have a comfortable life more outgoing um i always feel fee i feel very confident with my thoughts and i like people to know what i have to say um i listen to music and i sit with my girlfriend and she calms me down when im stressed out i could work on that im not very good at that last night with my girlfriend she was asking my advice on something and as i was speaking to her she felt my tone of voice was too loud i was not angry but i was irritated that i was being told to quiet down when i didnt really wanna help i just wanted to relax laughter i agree um sometimes when things dont go my way i get depressed or upset and i wish i could calm down and just realize that i should count my blessings and look at the bright side of everything no matter how bad things get always look at the bright side thats my goal its been very difficult but im working on it and it seems to be getting a little easier well when i was taking care of my mother and she was dying of copd and then it turned into lung cancer i chose not to tell her that her condition had worsened so she wouldnt be fearful and i had to sit knowing that her symptoms were getting worse but i couldnt tell her the truth and i let her think that everything was okay it was uh my mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for three years and me seeing her health decline thats what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts if i could erase that if that never happened i would feel better oh i dont know i try to uh be grateful im alive and try to focus on my own objectives and not dwell on the negative things of my memory my girlfriend shes a very good positive po positive influence she wants me to be a better person she since i met her shes been trying to make me not be angry to make me not feel negative and to be a nurturing positive zenlike man so what shes asking for is something thats gonna make me improve therefore i must capitulate its very easy i sleep well sometimes i wake up when i have nightmares about my mother or something but uh i go back to sleep thats unknown i dont know it just happens ive been feeling uh good eh the my reality is ive been hit with a lot of financial uh problems but im handling ha handling them well actually ive been looking at it as my girlfriend has told me that i need to do this so therefore it is on the forefront of my mind right now no no today when i woke up and it was a sunny beautiful day and i had a lot of goals to achieve and im achieving each one one by one it gives me a sense of accomplishment and happiness my ideal weekend would be playing music with my girlfriend as thats something we enjoy to do healthy hea going out to a nice dinner of healthy food and maybe exercising and feeling good with my body and mind and spirit uh probably as a strongwilled person with a big heart but has a short fuse and maybe complains about his own life too much i wish i could not complain about negative things that happen and learn to roll with the punches and always look at the bright side well one time i had a good friend tell me that one of the recordings i did he thought was horrible and then i felt it was the best thing id ever done so that and i would dont understand how anybody could could feel that way and i didnt know if it was from jealousy or it was an honest opinion opi evaluation so therefore i felt bad about that as its my goal no nothing i regret i felt hmm ten or twenty years ago i dont know um sigh well everything i do i enjoy its hard to to pick out one exact event that i really enjoyed uh i dont know how to put one above the other when things dont go my way and finances xxx come down and i dont get jobs that i go for that i am qualified for but i feel i am not getting my fair chance at opportunity its very frustrating i dont really feel guilty about things sometimes maybe if im angry and i shouldnt be i feel guilty about that i dont ever wanna be short with my girlfriend ever she wouldnt doesnt deserve somebody um using vulgar language or shouting or something so i dont wanna be that way around her so therefore that i am guilty my achievements of my abilities through my music and my other abilities that i have and of my hard work has paid off and uh im very proud of those okay thank you goodbye
synch yes im wonderful how are you california mhm yes the weather is one of em uh the food um and the way uh everything is centrally located mhm the traffic the smog and um its just gotten really really overcrowded um i wouldnt say a lot but i do try to um travel um at least once once or twice every two years um just exploring different things and being able to um have different experiences um things of that nature and you know learning new things and um just different cultures uh i like to um learn about different cultures and when you travel um you get a sense of um you know feedback from different cultures and different areas so i like that um well i just came from miami uh last year i went to miami for a week and a half and it was really nice the weather was great it was my first time going um and um the weather was wonderful the people are really nice and um it was really a great experience i went out there for um a particular event um they have um something every year um where everyone comes out from all over and uh you just kinda party and hang out and meet new people it was really fun um well from that trip i would say um swimming in the beautiful beautiful beautiful um miami beach waters was wonderful yeah it was um child development mhm well um ive always been interested in children um since i was younger um i babysat a lot so i had a lot of um experience with kids at a young age and as i grew older um i realized that it was something that i liked to do um so uh thats when i um looked into child development courses and i thought that it was something um like that i would enjoy en enjoy doing so um i started taking classes and um the rest is history i am yes its been um fifteen years in august yeah my dream job i would say um to become a principal well its something that um ive thought about doing for a while now and um ive actually just began the steps to try to get that going so um im gonna be back in school and im gonna be taking courses um so that i can make that happen because it is a dream of mine yeah thank you um its gonna be pretty difficult um there is uh several years of schooling that i have ahead of me and um you know its definitely gonna be a challenge but its something that im up for because it is a dream job of mine so its something that im willing to im willing to do um a little bit of both i think a little bit of both i can be shy at times um and and outgoing as well um but i think a little bit of both i would say laughter uh i meditate i im im a big big meditator so i love meditating i love just um reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time oh wow im very very good at that very good at controlling my temper i um again um a series of meditation that i do um it involves deep breathing and um just really centering yourself to where you can feel your heart beat and you can um really feel everything in your body and it really really allows you to destress and to control anxiety and anger and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot oh wow it was just recently um actually unfortunately it was last week and it was with my husband and um it was about um just the way he responds sometimes to me uh it can be a little aggressive um and were just trying to work with that because i dont respond well to aggression i totally tune out and um thats actually what happened so yeah that was it i felt very frustrated um and i actually felt angered too um but more frustrated and i felt saddened too because i dont like arguing so it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time uh sigh a situation which i wish i wouldve handled differently honestly i havent had a situation like that in in years ive pretty much kind of um you know kind of mastered my responses um to certain um stimuli ive kinda got that down the hardest decision ive ever had to make well it was when i was sixteen years old and i became a teenage um mother i was pregnant at sixteen and um i had um a lot of pressure from family to um give my child up for adoption or to um abort and i chose life so that was that was one of the hardest decisions if not the hardest decisions to make as a sixteen year old teenage um teenager just whether i wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager or whether i wanted to embark on raising a life um when i was just a child myself so that i think was the hardest decision i had to make um well i mean um my son is almost nineteen now so its nineteen years later and um i actually um am so glad it was one of the best things that i ever did by not choosing to abort him and choosing choo being prolife prochoice prolife and um eh i i have not regretted the decision um thats my only child and i love him he is just a blessing hes just a blessing and i feel very special to be his mom i do yeah um no its its not easy uh it definitely um has its difficulties um just as anything um but at the end of the day it is really rewarding um and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that youve raised become a productive citizen and go out into society and just start making their way and its really rewarding it really is oh wow so many ways um the first way wa uh the first way is i actually listen to my son and i um accept his feedback even if i dont like it and i um allow him to express his self fortunately unfortunately when i was little um there was not a lot of um conversation from parent to child um it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self i allow him to give me feedback um negative or positive because i feel that its really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age and um as parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of um make sure that you nurture that um because thats kind of um the way that they develop you know and its really really important so im different in um in a lot of ways in that rite thank you um sigh well it depends um sometimes it it really depends it depends on the time that i go to sleep it depends on the time that i woke up so its a lot of factors um i cant just give you one answer um i would say that it varies sometimes i can go to sleep um and fall asleep right away and other times i can go to sleep and it might take awhile to actually fall asleep so it varies ive been feeling great lately i i really have been um i cant um say that like i said the last week didnt affect me um you know the argument with my husband but other than that i ive been feeling really good no i havent no i have not you know what honestly i feel happy every day you know every day i wake up im happy because that is a chance for me to take advantage carpe diem seize the day so um i feel blessed every morning i wake up its a blessing you know because i realize that some people did not wake up some people are homeless some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening and thats not me so i feel really really blessed every day thank you um as um nurturing patient loving friendly um kind of reserved um well i wish that i had um already completed college and had my masters degree and sometimes i wish i was a little bit more knowledgeable in certain subjects and um i can change if i can change anything i would change that those two things and also i would be um a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert you know what no regrets no regrets um you live and learn um nothing is perfect um everything that ive gone through has made me the person that i am today so i wouldnt change anything because im happy with the person that i am today oh sigh man to stay in school to stay in school and to get your education and put that first and foremost before a relationship even before your career um i really really uh would wouldve told myself um to stay focused and to get a great education im most proud of um where ive come from um as a teenage mother um being a statistic and actually changing that being on my same ive had my uh same job for fifteen years now im really proud of that ive been married for thirteen years im really proud of that happily married um to my best friend and my soulmate nothings perfect but um hes my best friend and i love him and im also proud of my son um being the mother that i am and the son that ive raised im proud of the job that ive done and im um i really um applaud myself for that youre welcome you were wonderful thank you buh bye
sync yeah thats perfectly fine im feeling great uh its an early morning i dont have school im excited laughter uh born and raised in los angeles california mhm uh the fact that you can surf snowboard and like do two drastically different things in one day uh coming from the neighborhoods ive lived in uh tisk id say the population of uh lower socio economic backgrounds it its like a cesspool almost for young african americans and it sucks uh not really ive been to new york connecticut mexico and texas but pretty young hmm laughter uh mostly if im traveling by plane just the sight and the air is amazing its remarkable uh the first time i went to new york i was about eleven years old and i made sure i got the the window seat on the plane and just the feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but uh we left um tisk at night here in la and it was the next day in new york so it was kind of confusing getting used to the time change the first thing i remember doing was uh getting a slice of new york pizza it was it was delicious laughter yep laughter scrubbedentry graduating with a bachelors degree in communications so i can go into the military as an officer actually its like what i dont know its like you gotta have a plan and thats the only thing thats just fallen into place and it seems like its going to fall into place for me hmm to be honest a job that doesnt exist laughter its however you can get paid to do nothing laughter yeah but uh probably i was just definitely shy as a kid but ive grown into myself through the experience of college so im way more outspoken uh i write music and i work out mostly so if im feeling stressed out i just do a set of push ups and lift some weights im pretty good um i saw a therapist when i was a kid for about a year and uh i dont know it it taught me to just be able to control my emotions and i dont think i do it in the best way because when im angry i do decide to like just bottle the my emotions in instead of letting them out in their appropriate outlets uh not really its been more of uh an interpersonal thing thats i dont i dont know probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that of that nature um sigh hm sigh so many um i guess in my senior year of high school i waited to the last minute to apply for the uc schools and it was unsuccessful because i didnt get to turn in the applications and im pretty sure i wouldve been admitted so it sucks but hey that is an intriguing question sigh um ive actually no clue the death of my grandmother sure um my grandmother died when i was eleven years old she raised me from the time i was born because my mother was unable to take care of me she raised my sister my brother and my cousin as well and her five children so she was the matriarch of our family and sigh the closest thing ive had to a mother and it was it was tough but um its gonna be seven years this may next on the thirtieth and uh ive grown quite a bit no more tears uh im a foster kid so i was emancipated from the foster program uh about two years ago now but um my immediate family im pretty close with them and i see them as much as i can and uh my foster family theyre awesome ive known them since i was five so its been pretty cool fairly easy i fall asleep pretty quick its not a problem except for when my backs hurting you know then its a problem mm tisk a little moody in the morning i guess i drive more aggressively laughter uh a little stressed about a few problems that i can take care of but i shouldnt stress because i either can do something about it or i cant and thats just the way things work uh sure um hm hm uh i have uh a few parking ticket not parking tickets theyre not moving violations but theyre tickets and i was unaware of if you miss court without being in the hospital or being in jail that you couldnt be excused from not making ma making your court date so i had three failure to appears in court which sucked tickets that are thousands of dollars and i have no money so i dont know its its pretty tough to deal with when youre trying to make something out of your life but therere so many barriers and obstacles that like you have you didnt forsee so i dont know it gets stressful at times and yeah thinking about it for periods of time some days i just sit and im just lost in my thoughts and i dont really communicate to anyone because theres nothing anybody can do for me really so i i just bottle it up like i do everything not very after doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing i i i believe no no hm really happy oh why is that such a difficult question uh mm i dont know im pretty content with everything right now i dont know about extreme happiness every day is just the same day seems like uh dunking across the street at the clippers center theres a basketball court there and uh ive been working on it for a while and i finally got up laugher yeah mm i have four close friends that ive known for over uh eight years uh each and i dont know studious hardworking determined mm i dont know laughter yeah laughter mm probably my metabolism which i dont really have control over is uh i dont know im pretty content with myself hmm sigh i think in uh my sixth grade year of uh uh grade school i was uh i wasnt the best of students but i had a teacher who was diligent and like he failed me through the whole year but i i learned a lot and uh i developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation i overcome after feeling so bad and down uh the same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because if it wasnt for his like sterness i dont think i wouldve getting the discipline to be where i am at now in college and stuff so hes been pretty influential uh i remember this time i was in the desert or uh uh up in joshua tree with my best friend and his dad and we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully and then his jeep wouldnt get over a rock so it was it was pretty yeah it was it was um tisk it was kinda weird i i thought i was superman i tried to move a rock that was thousands of pounds didnt work but yeah we eventually got out we thought we were gonna be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time i got to drive in the desert when i didnt have my license so it was fun yeah about that day or in general mm other than like the uc thing like where i didnt apply to the schools in time i regret that yeah hm i dont know i was i was ten years old ten years ago laughter uh id probably say to myself uh sigh i i have no clue thats thats an interesting question uh being the first from my immediate college coll uh immediate family as in my mother my brothers and my sister to go to college so yes its its pretty in yeah no problem
sync yes doing pretty good oh i was born in uh brooklyn new york i came out here when i was seven and ive been here ever since uh i dont consider myself anything but a californian laughter uh im a welder um i just i dont know something about it making and um building things and repairing things that intrigued me and uh uh i was actually pretty good at it so i stuck with it and and thats my profession sigh gee i really never had that ive just uh sigh kind of always uh hoped that i would have a job that could support myself and my family and uh i was satisfied with that well uh i just recently lost my uncle and uh he raised me since i was seven years old and uh other than my wife i dont have any more family um he passed away last uh july and uh im starting to get over it um i knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so ive been depressed about that and uh uh but im doing better it depends on the atmosphere um if im around people that i dont feel comfortable with im kinda reserved but uh if im comfortable and uh i feel like i fit in well im outgoing laughter laughter right i enjoy old movies uh old uh well its called film noir and uh i love those old black and white movies and i get on netflix or amazon and i try to pick a movie thats uh from back then people were different than they uh i dont know its just a different era and i enjoy it sigh well my wife says uh i probably not as good as i think i do but uh ive got to admit sometimes i lose my temper and it is according to her over things that i shouldnt be losing my temper about but um im working on it and uh i have basically had this problem ever since i was a young child oh yes laughter uh ive uh been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger im im passed that point now but uh sigh you know when youre young you think you know everything and uh you know youre never gonna get old and the future doesnt matter but uh it does matter because everthing that you do when youre young uh follows you for the rest of your life and i dont regret things that ive done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices uh me and my wife we we w we dont argue we sigh disagree and its shes very strong willed and shes a match for me laughter so uh we go back and forth but you know we dont get violent and we dont uh uh say meanful things or hurt each other were just she is a determined strong willed woman and sniff i am who i am so we kinda go back and forth and lately i have been the one to sigh bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long run its just her and me and theres nobody else more important to me um sigh tisk when i was younger i wish that uh i didnt follow some of the people that i followed and what i mean by that is you know running in a circle with certain people and having an ego bigger than my common sense and um thats what got me into trouble sniff i was an only child and uh i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and um getting the girls to laugh or having people mm think i was you know cool or whatever you wouldnt think that now im kinda overweight and balding but when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and sniff if i wouldve had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so i you know ran where people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble hardest decision i ever had to make was giving the authorization to um have my uncle pass away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed sigh and um doctors said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him sigh go through any suffering to let him slip away and as you can see i get very upset my uncle raised me like his own son and never let me down sniff and hes gone and for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that sniff but as i said im getting over it and um things are getting better slowly my wife she is uh always there for me sniff she will laughter always surprise me we shes not my wife shes my best friend sniff and she laughter knows me better than i know myself um coughs we enjoy uh uh doing simple things its not that we cant do other things if we wanted to but we sniff mesh um sniff we enjoy each others company uh we like the same things and uh we you know occasionally go out and do something together but we clears throat we just enjoy each others company and she like i say knows me better than anybody and um it surprises me sometimes mhm you know sigh lately well i cant say lately sniff if i dont coughs excuse me if i dont do a rigorous activity or something that really uh stresses me or strains my body it it lets say for a couple of days im just very relaxed and you know not doing much i i just automatically get up after four and a half five hours i mean and you know my wife will say you know guy youre not getting any sleep but i mean i dont feel tired i dont feel exhausted i dont feel like i need to go back to sleep ill stay up all day and im fine and most people would say thats not enough sleep but you know for me im it doesnt affect me sniff well i wish some things could be different but uh im not dissatisfied sniff um uh im happy with my life uh there there uh like with anybody else theres a few things that i wish were different and i think thats in anybody everybody elses uh you know life but um sniff im im im im im content yeah i feel a little less motivated sniff um recently well i cant say recently this was back in january um my wife and a few uh friends were noticing that i was um becoming forgetful and i i couldnt remember things i i didnt see it and um you know when they when everybody brought it to my attention then i started to but anyway i went to the doctor and um they gave me the tests and apparently i have mci which is mild cognitive impairment and uh ive over the last month or so nobody has mentioned it to me i mean maybe im getting better but the neurologist that i saw sss is having me come back in a year and gonna retest me um hopefully its not the beginning stages of alzheimers im still a little young for that im only fifty fif fifty two but um i was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh it it couldve been due also i was told by him uh because of the death of my uncle i couldve been pretty depressed i was not able to retain things and so well im going back in a year and well see if uh im any better im sorry im not understanding you im sorry how h no no i have not yes two thousand one um i was in a um uh what is the word im looking for sniff i was in a um in a state of mind of of where i was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if i didnt seek any help um i was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder uh worrying and thinking too much about things and uh thinking the worst and uh i i take medication for that uh well w well you know its not really therapy its clears throat you know every uh few months you know you gotta see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription laughter its you know it its you know kinda like the next person next person it its i im with kaiser so its its theyll talk to you but it they give you the impression that um you know i i okay lets move along you know they theyll th theyll hear your explanation but you know it it they dont have all the time for you that you may want so i i i im doing fine now if i really needed help i would i would do something the medication works for me sigh last time i felt real happy well it would depend on what the event is im always happy when im doing something with me and my wife and were enjoying each other and i you know im not trying to sound like shes my whole world and i dont have anything else she is my world but um i i i enjoy being with her and were we we do things together and sniff i i im happy all the time when when were doing that um sniff when im outside of that circle i i i dont know if this sounds right but im not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as im content im not um i im not disappointed or im not uh wanting anything im you know whatever comes my way is fine so well um sniff i dont know i i couldnt give you that answer laughter um sniff well my best friend is my wife but uh sniff she would um describe me as uh i dont think before i speak um i um let the littlest insignificant things bother me and i get angry over but the big things its like i let it go and shes bewildered by that coughs um uh vocal fry years and years ago um she i had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten into a minor fender bender and she thought it was gonna be the end of the world cause that was my baby and i sigh you know hey dont worry well get it fixed and she was w she thought laughter that i was gonna hang her or something you know because that was my this was you know that was my baby and uh she goes you know you you get excited over nothing but you know i something like wrecking your car that you love and youve put so many hours of work into it and money you know it gets crashed and its like you dont care so thats the only way i can explain it well i i need to lose some weight as you can see laughter im definitely uh been on an eating binge uh and uh the neurologist said thats probably due to the event with my uncle um im heavy heav i am this is the heaviest ive ever been in my life and im finding it a little bit harder um i i cant say harder but im im finding the will power to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or you know not you know  movement now going maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks clears throat and we lived in a scrubbedentry uh boy you know look at that wonder whats inside there you know that thats uh we dont do that no more i guess its were a little bit older now and laughter a little bit heavier its harder to walk with all this weight laughter but i i i i wish i could change that because uh i i you know its just not healthy the size sigh sigh uh lately no i dont regret anything lately um sniff everythings been fine the like i say the the biggest biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and uh i never ever in a hundred years or ever thought that i would face that situation and sniff ill never forget it but they say time heals all wounds and and it does laughter dont listen to other people uh again im not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to uh he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they um the young lady that i was talking to in here they think theyre invincible and so did i laughter i figured ah im never gonna im never gonna have those problems um i wish i couldve changed some things um coughs the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that im able to do uh i dont miss them but if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldnt make some of the decisions that i made my welding certificates um im uh certified by the american welding society and ive uh sniff uh thats probably the biggest achievement that ive made for you know myself an accomplishment um clears throat uh people that i know say that im uh well i havent been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for uh restoration and working on vehicles and i dont see it but ive been told that once or twice but i ive kind of i ive kind of started to slip away from that i dont i cant say its from lack of interest but i just dont feel the motivation no more i wish i had a pocket of money and id have somebody else to it thats how i feel laughter okay well thank you bye bye
synch okay yes i am im good thank you laughter originally from los angeles and my parents are from central america yes the weather um i like that i can get to the water if i want to uh to the hills or hike or just any element that i wanna get to i can get to traffic laughter busyness everybodys always in a hurry um um thats about it laughter when i can i have family in central america and when i can my husband and i we try to go to warm places like mexico or somewhere on the caribbean the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something i said i would do if im at home and if im too far away from home to do it then i dont have anything to worry about laughter um recently i went to honduras again thats where my familys from so it was sort of like a its its a dual fold i get to see my family but i also kinda get to be away from home so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom and not feel like im obligated to being with them so its more fun that way experiences on vacation or um most memorable experience probably hawaii in lahaina and just having i love food im a foodie so having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it just ive never been able to taste it that way any time else so its like a very memory its a deep memory for me cause no matter what i do to my pork itll never taste like that pork in lahaina laughter business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field so ive enjoyed i my business background did help me in the marketing field my dream job hmm well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldnt have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job im outgoing laughter laughter thats cool laughter uh depends on where im at if im wherever im at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way im always in control no matter where im standing at and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation figure out what i can control what i cant control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda deep breath sigh breathe and get a hold of myself first im actually very good im actually very mildtempered to begin with um i dont really let anything agitate me and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just do my own little self check you know eh i mightve cussed i mightve went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm its not worth it this persons not worth it the situation is not worth it be who you are and just stay there actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it and i was i didnt want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasnt feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways and then i found myself now in a debate and then thats when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it im not asking you to make me feel any differently im just asking you to acknowledge my feelings when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know hes very a macho kinda manly guy i didnt want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard hmm sigh lets see i can my son comes to mind hes twenty two years old and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and its okay im okay with it hes used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him as opposed to waiting him to call me and i think it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i wouldve kind of adjusted that so that he wouldnt be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come and check on him he doesnt live with me he has his own place but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that hes okay i think this is probably way more laughter ethereal than you meant but i wouldve i wouldve done that differently i wouldve mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i wouldve treated him more of an adult and then also not expected him to just kinda you know i wouldve killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense woo laughter no its not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kids needs ahead of your own and i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as theyre okay youre okay so it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally so my parenting has become easier the more and more ive lived in that truth where im not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldnt make uh it could be as simple as an outfit laughter you know choice or as much as a career change but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that i i didnt wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didnt wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily its nothing major with my kids but whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me its fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so its just its a real its an honor that i was able to do it its an honor that theyre healthy um and its fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own and its like theyre mini mes but then theyre also different than i am and so its fun just being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so im enjoying that wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing its just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent divorcing my first husband um cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore and since i did that the domino effect has ha was is this is not virtual it happened laughter we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while um and then i just made some decisions to where i didnt wanna go through so much court hassle so i just did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids thats all i cared about in terms of losing everything physical and and all the material stuff i could care less but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didnt feel validated as a woman or as a wife and thats just who i am and those were the very areas that he didnt validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be im not im not here to talk about that part of it bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasnt prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low selfesteem i you know i wasnt perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return laughter you know what its actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that im ashamed of today did i cross anybody did i not do you know and im not being sanctimonious or acting as if im pollyanna but i believe in karma im a godfearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today and if theres something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day really good light um you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son my daughters a teenager so shes kinda coming into her own so thats a different relationship shes opposite of me im im actually very easygoing very bohemian style shes very social very you know just out there so im having to just kinda find our balance but overall its just i i wont complain im very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not laughter no i havent thank god no really happy lets see uh its at home and i think it was when wow mumbling different things running through my head um i think when my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understanding underst eh understanding on our mother daughter relationship im not trying to be her best friend but yet that doesnt mean she cant talk to me and i think when she came to me the other day and just kinda gave me a big hug from behind me without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me laughter thank you um laughter im easygoing im fun im just very you know um eh chameleon comes to mind i just kinda acclimate to what whatever situation im in im very honest im very real and just you know bold if i have to be um im just very adult im an adult woman and you know they would just decribe descr or my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do and i just you know i dont i dont deal with b s laughter hmm what could i change about myself uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh thats not even true let me think what what what are some things i would change about myself um sounds weird that i would say not much m nothing really um i think i would just be a little bit more aware of others i think im a im super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware make sure that im not being selfish or im not tuning anyone out just because i wanna get through my yoga or i wanna do something else i think i would just be more um observant and aware of those around me to make sure im not offending anybody i dont have any regrets i i think about that all the time and you know its its natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do eh but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me so i cant you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret because i know i learned from it um probably sounds very textbook but thats true thats just really how i live so i believe that everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it what im supposed to take from it and take that into my future so im to take the you know the hard knocks with the with the joys hmm be real with myself thats thats one thing that took me twenty years to kinda get to um just to kinda be honest with myself to embrace who i am to just you know get to know who i am uh learn my own infrastructure be comfortable with the uh with the innate things that are a part of me dont try to revamp re dont try to revamp myself or try to become something that im not uh i wouldve still chosen the same marketing career to still i wouldve still climbed the same corporate ladders but i wouldve done it from a more internal place um not that i lost myself in it but when in terms of my family life i wouldve just been more true to myself and that way i wouldnt have had any kind of resentments my family my uh my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately thats where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what at the end of this lifes this life uh this body uh in this leased vehicle that im in um all im gonna do or all im gonna be is an epitaph laughter somewhere in a cementary scrubbedentry and im always just true to that i mean i ive been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realized i wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that i think that ultimately that thats where my true fulfillment comes from laughter cool thank you bye

therapist and a lot of times the issue is resolved there it wasnt a big issue or i worked through it or the therapist through the therapist allowed me to look at a different way of looking at the situation and in that way i find therapy to be invaluable actually i believe so uh yes i was i believe it was i think it was told to me by a psychiatrist that thats what i was thats what i was having and this was within the last five years i think it was looking back now what are we two thousand thirteen it was two thousand nine so four years ago not able to deal like shell shocked not able to deal with anything eh irritable on the phone uh i mean just uh just anything would get me to fly off the handle and um just uh not able just shell shocked and not and hiding at my in my house not opening mail m mail not being able to concentrate not being able to deal with with things that were that i felt were well that were bombarding me i felt overcomed o overcomed and um the psychiatrist said that it was posttraumatic stress disorder but um and i was given some medication which i stayed on for a year or so uh or so and i dont know through psychiatry and therapist and medication um i was able to come out of my shell a little bit hmm about a week ago i was on a hike eh up in malibu and uh at this beautiful labyrinth that looked over the pacific ocean and we i was with a friend and

sync yes okay other than this laryngitis i have uh cleveland ohio in uh seventy nine i think it was laughter mhm um once a year something like that or less um uh theres a lot more to do here um theyre a little more narrow minded back there and republican laughter um well originally show business but probably to get away from uh cleveland it was very difficult at first um im not used to uh change i dont like change very much you know having to uh meet new people and figure out how to make a living well i like the um different opportunities you have the different the health consciousness the movies um the variety of things you can do the places you can go the weather um the driving the congestion some of the superficial attitude the importance mhm um well not a lot but i do i just came back from vegas to visit relatives we met there and im going to mexico um next month um well seeing the different cultures like been to europe greece france p um italy um i like going to places such as mexico where its gonna be sunny and just lying out i went to last year i went to arizona i never saw sedona that was really uh an experience pure peaceful about sedona yeah well sedonas a very energetic place and um i thought it was desert like flat kind of desert looking but it was its very rocky and when you land in flagstaff theres these beautiful uh pine trees and its the elevation is high and and coming into sedona was very beautiful and and after a day the pain in my back went away that i had there for months so and you had this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had this energy so it was really um very mystical in life laughter or in sedona in life um well being on stage in boston and um that was great i i loved doing that um um just being with friends and laughing are some of my highest moments when were laughing hysterically well um i dont know of a particular situation but when i when i decorate for special events and um i worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and just laugh and and i i cant think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but just being with somebody whos in tune with my sense of humor and uh gets my jokes and you know i get his and were just um enjoying that moment um speech and drama i i majored in uh no not now i always was interested in um musical comedy when i was a child i would sing along to records in my living room and i was always in choirs in school and then when i uh went to high school i joined the drama club and i i just always had an interest and i always had a a big personality and well laughter um i dont know if i have a dream job anymore im sixty and i dont know if i have aspirations anymore towards towards doing anything right now id just rather not work laughter and just um relax and travel but um i i like being creative in in any way i can i like independence and i kind of have that right now so im okay um well i i watch my favorite television shows that ive recorded and i also am a buddhist ive been a buddhist for um gosh since nineteen eighty eight and um im a district leader in my community and we have meetings and that really helps to center me and bring out my higher self so if i get tense or nervous i i chant um sometimes okay sometimes not a lot yes yes laughter less and less though its been happening less and less but um yeah sometimes its got its its um created difficulties well i cant c sigh i cant remember an argument i remember getting angry like was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving and the gps said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i got off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway about four miles out of our way and i just i got very angry for about thirty seconds and then i had to calm myself down and say okay alright so were gonna be late you know i had to talk myself out of it so it wasnt really an argument with anybody but i felt kind of bad that i overreacted um you mean in my life laughter manys yes um gosh theres so many laughter i i just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing information like theyre not gonna use me on a job or something that i would take an attitude that um ill find something better its okay and move on as opposed to feeling whats wrong with me and you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and you know that whole uh thought process that really doesnt help the situation and i do that more often but i since i started chanting but it doesnt you know im not always in my high life condition laughter where i can do that um i find a lot of situations laughter hard to make like you know what television to buy or something laughter but um um i guess gue i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences and um um or leaving my  comfort zone z place if the decision meant that i have to leave my comfort place that would be a very difficult decision for me and probably leaving a relationship very hard because you y you know i get dependent on that relationship so i usually live it out til its for you know its they leave or something you know its very hard for me to make that decision that this isnt right and i have to move on so what i usually do is i dont make the decision and i end up suffering but longer so mhm can we move on um well uh its hard because um i dont know if its because i have pain in my back and neck but i i its difficult for me to stay asleep id i i i dont get a um a deep sleep um but at because of uh well i so okay its hard to say because right now i i have this cold and ive had it for two weeks so ive been taking nyquil and thats been putting me to sleep so i have been um sleeping better because of it but last night i i woke up coughing so its its hard to tell but before that all happened i was um finding it difficult to stay asleep and so therefore im tired during the day and uh sometimes im groggy sometimes im irritable but yeah im not really sure if its related to this pain in my back or emotional things or or or or not im sorry could you repeat that have i studied changes in my behavior uh no laughter i was not no mm mm oh i was happy last week laughter you know well i uh was going to um vegas to meet my family was my my family was flying in from cleveland to uh there we have a a relative in uh vegas and i drove with my friend and it was my brother in laws seventieth birthday so we all went and had a good time in vegas i mean i was struggling through my cold but but it was fun it was nice well laughter uh they think im funny um they feel that i say it like it is um they understand under they all say they understand me laughter so people who dont understand me i think sometimes dont know how to take me cause ill ill say something sometimes come out come across sarcastic but just ju thats just the way i talk so um my um the anger that sometimes wells up in me you know i just but although that that really made me i think a lot of the person that i am you know all all of your experiences make you who you are and how you handle them makes you who you are and if you dont have those lows you dont really know what highs are so i dont i cant really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didnt happen whatever but really what matters is today and now and how you handle today and i wish that well i can i dont wish i know that i will have less of these moments where ive just blurt out you know anger or something i just wish that would happen more less that the anger parts would happen less and they are so i guess it will laughter happen less um dont give up hope live in the moment and um everything will everything will work out everything will work out and if you believe that then you really have nothing to fear um the fact that now and for the past twenty years twenty some years ive been cultivating myself and ive become be ive become more um compassionate person and im able to um uh ss understand people better and see that you know their suffering ss theyre suffering too and that if you if you treat people from that respect that theyre they have their problems too and theyre suffering with their problems too youre able to live a better life because youre not allowing that to affect you youre not taking it personally and at the same time youre becoming more compassionate person and when youre more compassionate youre youre happy and your life is happy okay

beautiful thing i think i found mm mhm laughter um it depends on the situation if im um if somebody comes to me looking for me to help them i take control but if i need help its eh i i work at asking for help so it depends on the situation mhm i garden and i paint mm im very good at it uh three days ago it was about communication it was uh the lack of communication on the other persons part and i needed them to communicate better so that way i could understand uh they didnt communicate so we had an argument and uh got it settled laughter i felt um caught off guard because this is a individual that i spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with and to not be told what was going on in this persons head and then to have a situation arise you know i was kept out i didnt like that uh mm id rather pass laughter mm uh um probably the lack of time spent with my grandparents growing up its just when theyre gone you regret that you didnt miss time with spent time with them so mm uh one thing i truly wish i could remember i i was a i was a professional athlete at one time and i had partied til like four in the morning and then i had did my event at like ten oclock in the morning and

believing in people and seeing how it worked and i decided to do that i wanted to help people too yeah oh yeah yeah yes i wanna paint thats all i wanna do is just paint laughter um i have two sons and its time for me to uh to move on and theyre older and they can take care of themselves now so me leaving the area where my sons are its pretty hard yeah oh the reflection of you laughter the reflection of you reminds you so much about yourself who you are consistency even when youre sick laughter being consistent i dont assume my kids are right or wrong i listen to em first and i make my decisions after that and i try not to come from an emotional heightened place i think logically and i put myself in their place before i do it we discuss we communicate heavy in my family uh cause thats the only way we get along with each other is through communication so communicate um my family is severed pretty much so my family and my relationship with my family on the reservation is very tight um the rest of the family were all fragmented and scattered around the southwest so its not very tight at all uh i have too many to count um start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad raised me a good way uh xxx uh he watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age um he also taught me to protect my family and taught me honor taught me love hes a good man mm i dont i havent had a good nights sleep in years so i i have get broken sleep uh dreams the dreams become too real i get up and go to the bathroom laughter and go back to sleep laughter i try to laughter um sigh um my years of fighting it just uh it caught up to me xxx uh reserved yeah reserved and i try to find things to distract my brain i think of different ways of doing things uh mm well i got rid of tv about eight months ago so i got rid of that distraction so what i do now is i either paint i garden or cleaning house washing dishes you know or get out and go walk thats another thing too do a lot of walking nowadays uh anxiety anxi anxious sigh uh um a lot of anxieties uh but its good i have techniques to bring myself down now um nothing new out of the normal yes uh three years ago sigh around there three sigh insomnia issues um it was about two years ago around there two little bit over two years ago i was released from therapy oh the therapist released me um well i had i noticed is i still deal with pictures and emotions but what i do is now ive i really practice hard at taking care of myself and and getting to those places the things that strike me that get get me anxious or excited or angry ive learned how to work out of it and realize its not real its not real its just the emotion its not real so these are the things like little mantras that i tell myself and this has really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly arent real and yeah so therapy has helped a lot i mean its just its changed my world yes around the same time as the ptsd uh three years ago um sigh in my dreams when i dream i do last night i was just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight and that was another thing too i build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then i always end up fighting in my dreams so its always mm what gets me scared in all my dreams is that i shouldve made the move and finished the fight and i didnt and so it builds anxiety and stress in me and then i tend to act out in my sleep yeah like it was real like i was there like like i smell taste feel everything there i was there yeah uh this morning laughter driving here talking to my girlfriend this mm trustworthy he loves me i love him hes were best friends i have zero to change mm i cant recall regret uh just not spending time with my grandparents and and i think day to day issues maybe you know a couple here there that i shouldve went to the store first or

santa barbara and we found some rocks and yeah some old rocks that someone had made a pile of and just threw a dump of old rocks out of the way and i went through the pile of rocks and i found this old rock that was in the middle of it and i took it home and now im doing a art piece on it and for me it was like this thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock and now potentially itll be sitting on my grandkids table you know its just to me thats really cool i like that mm start starting something that im so bad at that i dont think theres no way i can be good at it and all the sudden i get to be better at it to where i dont even have to think about it just so good at it that way i could just touch it and feel it and i dont think about it i these are the things that im proud of like i like that i like that accomplishment i guess you can say mm bye laughter

synch yes very well uh ohio mhm uh finished school and came out to start my life uh not often now not really often uh because my parents have both passed away and so thats my reason for that was my reason for going home prior uh theres really not a comparison you know this is warm and sunny and that has four seasons so its a very different environment i it took a minute to get adjusted to the different culture but uh after i was adjusted you know the sunshine keeps you here uh i love the weather i love the fact that i have the ocean and the mountains and um so many things that i can choose from and the diversity that i find here uh i tend to not have things that i dont like uh because where i am i know that im finding myself there so and i like me so that means that theres really nothing i dont like yes i do uh i love being able to explore different cultures be able to meet different people have a different set of experiences and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between uh all types of people its a very rich experience um which one to where uh i guess im thinking about egypt and the wonderful experiences that i have there uh as i go the people and the warm and loving experience i have the knowledge i get to pursue through the exploring the temples and the pyramids etcetera things like that there are so many there really are but i can think of uh seeing a baby in a mosque which was just really pure and it really stayed with me how similar we actually all are um thats probably one of the things that i remember most from one of my very first trips uh there and lets see just the interaction of the people the food you know incredible i love the food too wow ive studied lots of different things ive studied law ive studied um entertainment ive studied communications ive studied whatever i want to quite a renaissance woman laughter laughter ah its just always been my way to really explore all of the things that i enjoy keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive and um just allows me to be able to be fully developed as a human being being able to do that mhm um i dont have a dream job per se what i do have is a um desire to just be able to be free to do whatever it is that i choose on a daily basis so uh probably more outgoing mhm laughter well i start my day out very relaxed because i start my day with meditation uh and several s uh several other spiritual practices that i perform before i move uh around i get exercise so that uh i keep everything humming everything moving and uh then move forward from there uh excellent laughter i dont really have one anymore argued um cannot remember the last time that i actually had an argument um dont know what its about i imagine that the last time i argued about something probably might be related to money situation i wish i had handled differently you know i try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets to hold guilt about the way anything uh went because theyre all for me very positive learning experiences uh that i get to explore who i am through so i dont really see them as needing them to be different i need to learn from them or to um just really accept what is mhm hardest decision ive ever had to make um dont really have a quote on quote hard decision you know because i grew up in a way uh where my mother was extremely wonderful in the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say its your life and so um for me decisions dont really come as difficult to make theyre pretty easy to make because ive been making them since childhood so i dont really have a most difficult decision ive ever made mm event that i could erase from my memory i dont really have one that i can think of that would be so terrible that i would need to erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so theres nothing really to regret or erase uh very easy as soon as i hit the pillow im out uh great uh a little more uh physical exertion than normal  but uh still great laughter mm no not overall but again i attribute that and i accredit that to the spiritual practices that i perform on a daily basis that keep me pretty even tempered no mm no uh thats pretty much every day laughter i feel really happy every day im thankful im grateful for my life and uh im just thankful for everything that comes into it uh very smart uh very loving uh very intelligent funny uh outgoing thats probably probably what my friends would say uh theres really nothing that i think i need laughter to to do or to have or to be different uh about myself like im okay with everything the way it is really am laughter what advice would i have given myself ten or twenty years ago to know um to understand that everything that happened ten or twenty years ago was important in terms of developing the person that i am now and so to just be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life in order to be able to learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up recently really enjoyed uh uh cooked a very wonderful meal um cause i love cooking so that was something i really enjoyed mhm wow my my willingness to get to know myself through travel through exploration through practices and through the practical application of everything that ive learned about people cultures places and most importantly you know the god within me bye
synch yes im well thank you uh boston massachusetts yes i moved to la about a year after graduating college in two thousand and one uh quite often at least a couple times a year um god i love both cities they are polar opposite in many many ways but theres things about both of them that that i love uh to pursue acting and writing mm its still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the um the the the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what i wanted to creatively and it was different the social culture was different in a way where i from where i had grown up and it it suited me better my personality sigh oh god go i like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of you know kn creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path uh i grew up where it snows constantly and is very very cold so sounds obvious but clearly i like that its you can swim year round and uh i like that its theres always something to do no matter what day of the week it is what i dont like uh well i miss my family fam i miss that theres not no i dont like that theres not a big family element here i miss im a big family girl i miss my family i feel like its very crowded here but yet its very easy to feel eh sort of isolated alone here mhm mm i cant see your shoes but um i do mostly just not not too much worldly travel mostly back to boston and mm eh florida where my parents live but i do i enjoy traveling and take a lot of trips within california and around here oh just to have an adventure do something fun or if im going home it means im gonna see my family clears throat um one of my trips mm god well i like to drive up to northern california go to san francisco i have family and friends there always super super fun uh in god in college i with my college boyfriend when i was in boston i we drove we went to san francisco and drove down to la and las vegas and that was kind of how i realized i wanted to move here so that was very that was very that was a big one uh in general just clears throat mm memorable experiences i guess it would be moving here i moved to when i moved to la i got on a plane but didnt know anybody here and i just got i talked to a girl that i met online and agreed to be her roommate and she picked me up at the airport we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely the the the flight out here was it was big monumental i felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever mhm studied communications um got a lots of every lot of different uh writing writing styles i eventually graduated with a a concentration in public relations and a english minor writing to pursue writing writer uh well i guess you could say writer slash actress which is um but i guess writing is first hard very hard because you need to no ones gonna push you to do it you have to be selfstarter you have to make it happen so its very hard cause i dont possess that naturally in my personality i do but not as much as i need to i would say outgoing on in general i sigh sometimes take a walk if i feel tense um listen ambient music helps if i need a soothing background white noise calming calming area and just just your basic deep breaths and just sort of take a minute to to come back to a calm neutral place i am getting better no laughter um im okay ok im good at controlling my temper cause i dont usually have a temper too often but when i do and i lose my cool i have a hard time controlling it yes no laughter hmm mm argued with someone um god i guess it was a friend a friend a girlfriend it it wasnt it was about uh our our each separate perspectives on a a certain situation between us that were obviously very very different um and it started out as something big and then we just realized this is this is stupid we dont need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly sigh hmm mm i guess it wouldve been with uh an exboyfriend fighting with an exboyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that it didnt need to be i wish that i had just walked away from it mm i dont know if i couldve avoided the complete situation but i definitely couldve made the outcome much less chaotic hmm uh i guess that would be hmm walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life uh but that i really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and kind of sort of growing up like coming to a point where i have to say im gonna have to do something thats really really hard for sort of you know shortterm pain for longterm gain and i had to make sort of an adult decision relationshipwise but it was still carried over into other areas of my life and taught me that you know youre not always gonna feel great gr every decisions not always gonna be easy and feel good yes i was kinda forced to this issue just what was going on in life was sort of you cant ignore those signs just yeah mm i guess it would be a particular argument i had with somebody um that happened to be in sort of a public place and i got in trouble for it i wish i could erase that my relationship with my family fam i have a wonderful family im completely blessed amazing parents i have a brother and has he has a little girl so i have a baby niece that i love more than anything in the world and i could not ask for a better family theyre the ideal my parents for sure theyre just wonderful people that just taught by example and i feel like im a good mix of both of them its pretty easy i try um lately its been a little bit hard my sleeps been off but for the most part ive come to recognize the importance of it and its its been pretty easy sigh uh a little edgy or fidgety maybe a little bit out of it i might um might seem like im in a good mood cause i might be a little giddy and uh laughing more just sort of laughter high emotions but overall get um irritated faster and just um sweat more just feel feel um just a little off ive been feeling pretty good lately mm not really just trying to be more focused clears throat get things done um just trying to focus on what i wanna do careerwise and really stop wasting time or you know just procrastinating and and get things done and being inspired going and seeing you know being around people that are doing what i wanna do and just carrying it over to my own life no no uh oh just a couple days i was just in with my family and my baby niece in florida and thats why i went down there to see her so it was just awesome im always happy when i see her probably as um  very funny humor would definitely probably be one of the first things they would say joking always a little wiseass in my personality but um they would describe me as always uh unconditional there for them and just they know they know that im there if they need them always my drive being more driven and just getting things done mm i guess it would be well a recent a recent exboyfriend that was a a mistake of a relationship uh yeah sort of just uh i i think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and even though what he said didnt directly make me feel bad the whole situation made me realize wow the fact that im even with this person made me feel like im let allowing people into my life that shouldnt be there so im dumbing myself down and that yeah it was terrible yes i regret not listening to my gut instincts dont secondguess yourself sigh clears throat um great listener constant sense of humor uh very malleable in terms of eh people uh tolerant and comfortable around all just people from just all ages race gender whatever i just i crave diversity and love to just you know i just i i im people person and i um i start every day with a blank slate i um i did some acting work on a on a series with a really great group of people and it was it was a very cool cool creative experience very inspiring probably coming out to la on my own without knowing anybody and staying here and pursuing what i wanna do thank you goodbye
synch yes spectacular this is an interesting experiment laughter uh im from middle of nowhere iowa sigh uh may second of two thousand seven so exactly five years six years ago um infrequently like once every couple years uh the weather exists so its more extreme and then  its rather less exciting a lot less colorful uh winter in minnesota laughter uh it took approximately the drive in thats thats about all it took the lights uh the lights took care of the rest uh i really love that its a giant concrete playground at nighttime so that bycicles uh have free rein of the streets i like all the art i love the fact that theres so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and that if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here oh you know the traffic sigh the exceedingly high cost of living uh yeah those are those are my big beefs uh not nearly as much as i would like to ive done a little bit uh i like not knowing exactly how things are gonna go i like the fact that it forces me to uh deal with people to deal with situations in ways that i normally wouldnt have to uh last year i got to hang out in san marcos for a little bit after i split up with my ex and then after san marcos i went back to iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then i brought my little brother to los angeles laughter uh last week managed to go on a bike ride for cyclavia scrubbedentry as a laughter he was basically a rolling green light the entire way down venice boulevard and so he made he made a bunch of like national news and he was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group riding around on tall bikes and stuff the we didnt bat an eye we didnt blink because this is this is normal for our friends that wasnt even the most absurd thing hes done lately that was just a a happy normal sunday but our group of friends is so unusual that a normal sunday for us is extreme for everyone else laughter i used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you los angeles um clears throat once i found the right group of friends it was easy to be social it it drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing bombastic for the first time and it stuck um if i werent already the most relaxed guy already i would probably do things but when im really stressed out i i do all sorts of stuff it um usually i try to enlist my friends to help me do an art project uh what temper laughter uh scrubbedentry um laughter panicked cause i really wanted to make him not hate me and i mostly failed uh hard on him i mostly uh mostly got by with a couple of scrapes on my ego uh when  when that all went down i tried to to talk to him but i got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of having my sigh verbal gloves up i managed to take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over a trash can it was not my most graceful moment uh i feel guilty about lots of stuff um i feel guilty about eating more often than anything else cause i really love junk food its really good i have very little food willpower cause i used to be a fat guy im not sure what the hardest decision i ever had to make was uh made a lot of hard decisions i guess sigh it was pretty hard to leave los angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff but it wasnt even that hard cause it pushed me to do it so its a tricky question madam uh oh you know broken collarbone severe pain get surgery on it it all seemed like it made sense at the time laughter mm no my memories are important i have lived a spoiled blessed life and if i changed anything then it wouldnt be the same universe i like this universe laughter uh my little brother lives here hes awesome hes actually right outside waiting for me uh my mom is crazy my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy im pretty crazy uh but since most of the rest of them live so far away dont really have to deal with them too much relationship is positive and sparce uh jackrabbits been a pretty positive influence on me lately she is a magical creature uh well theres the part where shes intensely physically beautiful theres the part where she manages to hit me with the best inspiration words theres the part where she actually works on the exact things that make me excited theres the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then theres the part where she is a hundred percent kind and caring all the time all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that she does this all without wanting anything in return i dont know thats sigh smitten laughter uh laughter what a funny question how do i know them as though shes multiple people how did you know uh i know her through my bicycle friends sigh uh the hard part is going to bed but as soon as i get to to sleepland im pretty much there until an earthquake uh hits so i i get to sleep poorly but then im a pro at it so it doesnt matter deep breath less verbose and thats about it my dark circles get slightly larger and im pretty much the exact same dude because ive been doing it most of my life uh so stoked that i might as well be on fire um mm because the universe in its infinite uh i suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor uh has managed to convince me of the reality of magic in the arthur c clark sense uh so as a fortunate and cough vaguely aware being eh its my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this uh yeah uh my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate and im feeling more and more inspired all the time if i could just work on the motivation id be set mm not since you asked me on the form a little while ago no uh no i used to think i had it but who knows at this point that was awhile ago uh i was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then i moved to los angeles and started having fun mm and then thats uh yeah the rest is ancient history um twenty thirteen laughter uh sigh working on my shoes this morning was really nice doodling uh an art project that all my friends helped and put on thats that was really nice its a nice feeling laughter sigh thats a very good question im not actually sure ill ask him later today though um i guess im enthusiastic i am thesauric and i am sigh im gonna have to say highly analytical laughter uh itd be nice if i could get my super powers back thatd be pretty cool uh like turning on some of the fancier finely tuned and delicate machinery that chinese medicine has clued me into inside myself laughter uh thats a really tough one i think the thing that im most proud of would probably be sigh you know im not actually sure laughter oh all sorts of stuff but im working on that clears throat deep breath dont masturbate so much laughter uh jackrabbit really bad puns uh and dessert laughter no problem bye ellie
synch clears throat yes im doing fine thank you im from los angeles california yes um well the main thing i like the weather um i like the lifestyle i like um the variety of beach um snow we have it

bus car sometimes planes uh mostly what just i guess ill say mostly down south but it was really fun especially the road trips mhm um just general and also drama uh well my dream job is to become a real estate investor um well ive sort of really been into it ever since two thousand five um i just dont have the capital right now or the connections that um since i do like real estate im just going to start off as a real estate agent so i should have my license um sometime this year outgoing um well im not shy um it could be a little bit of both but um im pretty outgoing um well speaking of hawaii i did uh live there for a year and a half but what do i do to relax is either um usually take a nap laughter um take a bath um or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways um it needs to be worked on but um i know when to control it um when i need to um well me and my exhusband still get into arguments um it was just over a text message but um actually it was my fault but um usually its his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control but um thats usually how it goes laughter um well i xxx dont know what else to do except for pray on it because i thought once i moved into another house it would be over but i see that were still getting into it so um i dont know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right then let him be right i guess um probably quite a few things but i dont regret anything ive done in my life but um situation i wish i wouldve handled differently um just kind of everything in my life almost laughter i couldve done it differently or i would if i had the chance but im not worried about it cause i dont regret anything that ive done in my life the hardest decision um probably when i had to get a divorce that mm that may have been the hardest or one of the hardest decisions um it was just a lot of um a lot of stuff through the years um clears throat the relationship had kind of deteriorated um if the relationship between us was still good then the things that he were doing um i would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because um ive i would feel like well our relationship is good and its difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and theres just a lot of disagreement and arguing and problems financial problems and hes doing this so um i just decided just forget it i mean i tried but eh you know he didnt wanna cooperate so um well im happy with whats going on now i mean i wish that we could still be a family but since thats not going to happen yes i am happy with my life right now yes um something i can erase um mm i dont think i really need to erase anything um ive finally gotten over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that i cant think of anything to erase um its fair slash good um theres no problems right now so i guess ill just say good yeah theres no problems um well i would have to say my mother yes um well shes just always supported me and everything that ive done um whether its good or not so good so um i think thats a blessing mhm um sometimes sometime its not um well i just dont get enough hours of sleep i guess thats what it is as i would like to um sometimes so um thats more the problem i would like to get mhm um just sleepy sigh yeah sleepy tired feeling like i wanna go take a nap um ive been feeling fine mhm uh no theyve been about the same no no um really happy uh probably last week because i got over to a little bit of money so laughter um well i guess my best friend would be my mom or maybe my um entertainment friend that ive been knowing since ninety six i really wouldnt im not gonna say i dont consider him a best friend but we dont really hang out that much but he is very um generous to me and my mom mhm so um well right now i spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in but maybe after the classwork is out of the way um laughter maybe i can do something else uh myself well i do wish that um at times i could control my temper a little more and um of course i would like to lose weight um be a little bit more active and um i wish my skin would clear up um it was probably when i was in school um school years are terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals so um they try to make you feel like um youre nothing like youre piece of dirt under their foot so thats probably the last time as an adult no um i would say that im genuine um im honest um im supportive and um im just a good friend no um well uh twenty years ago um just because youre pregnant that doesnt mean that youre eating for two and you can eat loads of food like um people tell you laughter um thats the main thing um im going to tell my daughters no um just eat as you normally eat but eat more healthier um theres no need to gain eighty pounds when the baby is just twenty pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose um also if i came into any money now twenty years ago i was probably just thinking about shopping or um just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff whereas now i would um invest it um so yeah i think

sync yeah im okay uh im from los angeles mhm oh um the weather laughter the weather the weather the weather the beach the weather the beach the laid backness the driving instead of public transportation and the sporty um i really i dont know the lack of um uh uh mm i dont know theres not a lot i dont like about la as compared to most cities i really its my favorite and ive lived around the world i love it i love la a lot laughter yes ive lived in paris and ive been around the world a lot um uh its just um its fun and its its its its its its a blast its good to see new places its good to get to um get to experience all the fantastic um sights and and ss and cultures um uh well i mean um uh i i tended to actually do a lot of them um i probably would do them differently i think im more developed as a person now i i um i lived in paris for two years so and i lived in spain for spain was fun spain it madrid is a party town and then um and then so these were all work they were all work so i was working so it was um theres a grind there you didnt really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then i mean i still um i still i love going just to you know vacation spots like hawaii and and jamaica im still just really a sucker for that kind of stuff um i guess madagascar was pretty much like just really bitching because it was um it was in the eighties and it was like you were seeing a lot of uh people that had never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around i might he mightve been lying um but it was just it was bitching africa was pretty much the best senegal and madagascar yeah um im right now about to go for an early childhood education degree and then i did a little bit of paralegal but that was really just to just to get the um just to get the stipend i didnt really have any concept of what i wanna do now i really do i have i was saying to rachel actually i dont know if you guys were able to overhear i really think that um the way the school system goes right now it um it just it it turns people into into um just um just uh dog eat dog um you know i i dont like the way the people peo it i think its so draining the um school system right now and i feel pretty bad for everybody so i wanna try to fix that that would be my dream job that so im excited that like i wanna go in a direction that i wanna go in and yeah that would be my dream job is to work with sort of getting um kids on a more um organic universal um you know uh trajectory um i think it could be done i dont think it would be done via any sort of um legislation except here and there i mean it it that always ends up for becoming you know facade and farce itself anyway but i think there are ways ive always reached kids anyway and theyve always felt where i was coming from and so i think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system uh i guess im just a combination of the two i dont think um i dont know actually im kinda i might even be working that out there might some outgoingness to overcompensate for whats actually shyness and vice versa so you dont know laughter yeah yeah yeah thats cool um i definitely um uh try to reflect and stay in a pretty lucid space as often as possible so a lot of lying down at the moment im in transition so theres just a lot of and i and i hang out with my dogs a lot so thats quite soothing i try not to do i dont really do anything thats too tense unless its time for it like time to drive to a job or time to you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise um i try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so its not like break and but you know and i i miss mi i miss swimming i cant believe summers coming so im gonna swim some more too um when im truly outraged uh it comes out and then i im im im hitting some kind of bad parts right now cause its a very hard time im fighting for my child so there are times when i will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam a little bit but usually pretty much theres always um you know someone in the periphery that gets it and and you know its like that bumper sticker if youre not outraged youre not paying attention so usually some kind of sanity can prevail oh well i mean these are times where i just cant find somthing in the car and but when i argue with people its been a lot of the times when im being flat out you know um sabotaged or or definitely just when uh whats the last specific time well i you know i lost my temper dreadfully with um unfortunately um the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic in a lot of i mean shes pretty much a horrible person so i i recently lost my temper with her i felt like um i mean i like again um i think i sort of said this just now i felt in a way good because i get it you know which is as opposed to not getting it which is even worse but i guess theres another side of the bank of the thing to get to to where you can be a little more constructive about it its like you know you get to a point where youre glad you can actually see that theres a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with the horrible travesty but so i mean i dont do i didnt feel like shame i really honestly didnt feel shame i didnt i didnt feel there are times when i feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because there are people that will try to use that against you thats all but i never really feel bad for being angry about what im angry about well when i was pregnant i wish i had um like i said um i i went through um such an awakening about realizing when i was being sort of um undermined that um that demanding my respect became a huge issue and when i was pregnant i ended up being so disrespected in the place cause i was being a hippie on the beach for six years so i always felt like i was being so disrespected in the place where um i was set to be when the child arrived that i stormed out via what was a good survival mode before but left me jumping out of the frying pan into the fire and they got my kid so yeah its fucked up yeah i dont want to erase anything from my memory i like having everything consolidated and cohesive i dont and integrated i dont wanna erase anything from my memory um well did i get it right or did i get it wrong laughter um yeah im uh i guess the hardest decision was whether or not to sign um sign mediation agreement with dcfs and i shouldve said no lets just go straight to court because the there is nothing wrong with me i just happen to succumb to an ssi check via bullshit with my mother and i shouldve just been you know um brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead i chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out overcautiousness its horrific horrendous bourgeoise quality intrigue and sabotage its bad its okay someone that i mean theres been um you know theres been some some great people uh again from afar i have not sort of really um achieved a real great ability to build relationships and im working through that right right right r right now and i think thats a lot why i dont have my son but as ive grown and developed ive seen encouragement from like minded souls and you can see that and so thats wonderful and um but otherwise you know a constant you know contact with someone thats really good for me it has been hard for me to um get to that point not so easy these days at all um im being ive been um im not completely centered and then theres been some um actual you know uh people thinking its funny to harass me or jolt me as they walk by and so theres been actual harassment and stuff like that um im still pretty pollyannad out i still forge ahead and try to be as pleasant as possible im tired and drained and a little bit um frustrated because that i know that um ive been sort of that i sort of have a bit of um my um energy and and space being usurped u usurped and i can tell and i dont know how to get through that and past it no no um there are im im im basically very very very happy pretty much blissed out person but um this fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that its as if the same trees that were thrown in my road in childhood before i realized i was such a happy person are thrown there again so im going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes but you know um during the day ill ill ill ill think something completely true and organic and i ill just stare at something and go wow thats beautiful and ill be reminded that im pretty close to my spirit so um i try to stay there twenty four seven im pretty spiritual that way um uh uh fun i mean if i had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me gets pretty competitive out there um that you know that im this is off you guys that im funny and that um and that um i think thats bad um that im funny and that im good and that that im trustworthy um just uh im im i not necessarily change but grow through um my ability to connect with the people i wanna connect with and disconnect from the people that manage to to drain me i already said i regret the thing with um leaving the place where i couldve delivered my son even though i was being um uh sort of abused get the fuck away from your mother laughter sorry um you know and like a lot of the th um and and yeah and to open your eyes look what look whats going on im proud of my um spirit and my outlook and my um my access to um whats really going on in the world and my um awakeness im just proud of me as a person okay youre welcome bye
synch yes i am i am pretty good uh i was born in los angeles california yes um i like the fact that everything is close by um all the stores the shops xxx um the traffic laughter um ive traveled but not too much uh going away from your usual days um exploring new sights um three weeks no a month ago i went to las vegas uh with wit me and my friends and we just went sightseeing um in las vegas we went to the hoover dam and um it was breathtaking um the it was really big and we saw the the big canyon and it was impressive ive never seen something like that before i studied nursing uh i graduated two months ago so i took my uh board exam to be licensed and i passed so im just waiting for my license in the mail my dream job is to be a registered nurse um long time ago when i was a little boy i got injured and my parent had to take me to the hospital and um the doctors came by and they had to stitch me up on the leg and i saw all of that and that made me want to pursue it the medical field uh yes i am very happy uh my relationship with my family is okay not good not bad its it its in between laughter uh i am close i am very close to them um mm if i have a problem i i go to them for help um someone whos been a positive influence has been my best friend since elementary school yes yes uh weve known each other since we were in the third grade and weve uh weve gone to elementary middle school and high school together and he lives like two blocks away so hes basically like like a brother of o of mine i am shy um i really dont know ive ive always been a quiet person um ever since i can remember hmm what do i do i i go into my room i turn my ac on and i just relax in my bed laughter i am pretty good im pretty good at controlling my temper yes the last time i argued with someone was about um work i was disappointed um not angry just disappointed because my manager he wanted me to do something faster than what i usually can handle and he already knew that um my workload was a lot but he didnt understand that so that made me just very like sad mm i cannot remember one the hardest decision i ever had to make was dropping out of school um i felt that i didnt really belong uh far away from home and so i was just thinking ahead um i was in a major that i didnt really like and so i decided to just not go next semester and go back home to la um right now that im looking at it yes i i am very happy that i did that because i wouldnt have gone to nursing school and i wouldnt have been a licensed vocational nurse right now hmm i dont have an event um it depends on the days um where i work or where i dont work yes right now i i work at um at a retail store early in the morning i i go at three in the morning and i get out at ten am so its really hard for me to get a good nights sleep when i dont sleep well i can be a little bit grumpy uh irritated or just frustrated with the situation lately ive been okay o okay ive been good uh no i have not no no hmm the last time i was really really happy and excited was when i found out that i passed my license board exam to be a nurse laughter my best friend wouldve described des would describe me as a caring nice sweet shy quiet guy um physically speaking i would change how i look from the outside um i im a little l im overweight and i would like to lose some weight and just look good from the outside hmm i dont have one no i dont um this one time i sigh at my work uh its a retail store i i kinda took some merchandise without buying it um it was a risk that i took but um since no one was around and the opportunity opp the opportunity was right there for me to get it i just got it and i took it home i dont know yes last weekend i went to i i went yard saleing with my family and it was pretty fun and going out to different yard sales and finding uh random stuff um i bought this big black bean bag it was huge and it was on it was only for two dollars and so i got it and now its in my room and i sit on it laughter i am most proud of is the fact that i am a nurse um that i am a nurse um im just waiting for my for my license in the mail and after that i would just send out my resumes to different hospitals and xxx and nursing homes bye
sync mhm um im doing good what about you mhm um la l los los angeles but i currently reside resreside in inglewood wait did i answer your question i dont know okay la um the murals the ocean what else the people my familys over here so thats the best part what about you oh wait yeah laughter um i would say the smog yeah the air it could be cleaner and yeah um thats pretty pre i mean theres good people and bad people too but yeah for the most part its all good um yeah ive been to mexico me uh mexico and the temples and northern california so yes traveling like cleaner air thats good its healthier for your body cleaner bloodflow the um people culture and stories and when you come back you share stories with like your friends yeah um any time like right now or when okay so like this one time when i was kid we went out to the temples and um it started raining so we just start walking through and like when we get to the top one thing i didnt know before is that the higher you go the the smaller the steps get so like people back then had uh smaller feet so what happened was as i went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways so my feet could measure up to the the the steps but once you get up there its a nice view i yeah uh general education but um mainly art yeah i took a lot of a lot of art classes um well when i was a kid i scribbled on walls with crayola so i figured you know like it kinda stuck around with me so i just pursued it so yeah my dream job would be to get paid for painting painting art yeah um yeah pretty simple um its not so much that its hard it just requires passion um persistence and faith and will you just have to really believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself the more likely you are able to succeed mhm i consider myself to be shy in certain um time and places but i am also out outgoing when like i have the energy so i feel like its well balanced you know like im shy when its i guess okay to be shy you know and im outgoing when like the need to actually um have fun or just explore it feels good like if that makes sense but yeah laughter yeah to uh relax um either well i dont know if i should say this but i smoke weed laughter so that helps and i like painting painting pretty much helps me relax you know especially when i use the color blue because the color blue um relaxes me and also green when i use these two colors and make a painting it calms calmcalms me down yeah and you have a blue shirt yeah my temper um well my thoughts my thoughts control my emotions and my emotions yeah thats pretty much how my temper i i try to make sense you know like is it worth getting mad or if i do get mad what will be the outcome you know so controlling my temper is just by training my thought um sigh the last time i argued with somebody was with my with my father and it was because i wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine so right when the food was ready i was hungry to eat and he was like no so that kinda frustrated me and the way i handled it was like well i could just eat when i come back and im doing him a favor so you know and then after you know i could just eat in eat in peace so yeah my family um its pretty good um my mom my dad have a good relationship still sstill married and my brothers and sisters um we help one another out so thats good its just yeah its like a team a situation i wish i could handle differently would be hmm thats a good question i mean can i get a scenerio okay um a situation i could handle differently well see thats the thing like i feel like if im calm in any situation i could figure it out you know but if it came down to like a rubiks cube maybe how would i handle the situation would be just by uh failing um failing making mistakes because i would make the right mistakes and the right lessons would come after so thats the best way i could answer your question you know yeah a positive influence pretty much anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence  influence  you know like yeah even though it may hurt like oh the truth does hurt well theyre not trying to be mean theyre actually good influences so i would say my friends uh my mom my dad my brother my sisters yeah mm well see thats the thing like you like i have ive had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife but at the end of the day what that did was like give me more insight it made me more aware and it taught me how to read people a little bit more like just sense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kinda like scar me it did prepare me for like the world you know because this happened to me when i was like twelve thirteen years old so i was already being exposed to like you know like guns knives and all that stuff so its its bad but its good in the long term you know because if you get out of that slump its like nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know in your head like oh ive been through worse so its not as bad you know and so yeah the hardest um man this one right now uh see for a the moment i got stuck i was like trying to think that was that was part of it but uh hardest decision as far as like life changing life changing whether to continue school college or not mm i kinda chose to like i went to school but i chose to pursue my own like like im learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field i wanna be in so that was a hard choice because there was no um guarantee that i would like run into like the right people but i took that chance and you know i met the right people so yeah yeah yeah um its actually really easy i sometimes yeah like if i wanted to i could sleep right now in like ten minutes you know i could just like shut down my mind like yeah just calm down like like slow down my air pattern yeah mhm lately ive been feeling good ive been feeling like i have free will like at this point in time i feel like if i chose a path any path with like my heart i could get there you know but im kind of like still deciding its like everything in all all these paths are in the air just trying to make my own i dont know thats where im at i feel like i have free will so yeah lately like in the past two weeks or today laughter okay uh yeah you know like um yeah things happen that would change like my feelings and for example right now it just happened huh for right now like this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought because yeah its like its technology you know its like its a trip to see how far like one could take a thought and then make it reality so thats kinda like shifting my thoughts right now this experience this this whole experience yeah uh post traumatic stress disorder no depression i know how its like to be depressed but diagnosed by a doctor no uh depression how how it feels how does depression feel like it feels like its like a bird in a cage being depression is like being ss a fish who cant swim in the water i have feeling depression is like being a bird without wings um pretty much it feels like youre limited but then the thing is to get out of that depression its like you have to awaken and change your perspective and focus on like i i would say colors colors help and people talking to people helps yeah um being depressed mm lets see mm i dont know like it could cou it could come like it could happen everyday in like in small doses doses so like i i could say today you know earlier when i was just by myself i felt a little depressed but then what happened i fixed it like called up a friend and met up with him and yeah um i mean at this moment i feel pretty happy you know im talking to a virtual person its pretty cool and yeah right now i feel happy laughter um sometimes hard headed like he would try to teach me um a certain lesson whether its art or just like in my character and yeah he would probably just describe me as like like like he would listen but at the same time hell still do what he wants to do so pretty much like i dont know yeah i mean thats what he tells me but yeah overall good person um probably just exercise um my diet food my food intake and yeah just exercise pretty much it my health mm i would say when i was like in middle school or in elementary a little bit of high school too but what it would yeah what it would be was it would either be about um well pretty much my art laughter like if i ever did something and i thought it was good then someone else would be like oh you know that looks kinda like like trash and then id be like oh damn either i could accept it and be like yeah it does kinda look and then fix it or what i would do back then would be like damn you know just kinda dwell on that thought and then just like stay there for a bit and then eventually ill come out of it but yeah usually its um peoples words and ideas that yeah yeah so thats it regret um yeah i got a couple things i regret like what well sometimes i feel like i shouldve completed a whole university thing but i mean at the same time i feel like if i really wanted to go i would have gone so yeah thats kind of a regret in my head ten or twenty years ago would be um seek spiritual well being you know learn how to um handle your thoughts choose your thoughts i would teach myself um pick the right r people you surround yourself with because that   definitely has a major influence in your environment uh certain events you would experience and as far as your overall happiness yeah yeah among other things but yeah what im most proud of right now is my paintings yeah im proud of that because like i feel like these paintings im releasing are things that no one else could duplicate you know its like its one of a kind and like its its there you know its has own signature so so yeah im im pretty happy about that yeah thank you alright thank you mhm alright bye laughter

synch sigh yes uh okay laughter los angeles the weather um the variety of um environments the ocean you know various different environment or environmental variety laughter um i dont like the superficiality of people um the narcissistic attitude um uh just the um uh it it doesnt have a small town sort of feel where you know just the warmth the human sort of warmth interactively so yeah no um i have um a fear of flying and i have um ive developed agoraphobia laughter uh incredibly difficult um yeah im im guessing you mean the agoraphobia um more so than the fear of flying um its uh its more of a recent um development and um its um eh its progressing pregr progressing um to be worse uh its very um uh whats the word um immobilizing and and very um distressing actually mhm laughter yes it is how to i cope with that um just uh just trying to um uh do the best i can and uh try to you know have the most courage i can in the situation and challenge myself in um small steps um i read a lot i do um bibliotherapy reading um and i try to inform myself um of the um of the professional literature um so that i could um hopefully overcome it someday mhm um yes definitely um uh certain things trigger it like um enclosed spaces um being in a car traveling um uh being away from home um being in someone elses car uh things that are outside of my uh locus of control um uh xxx actually i i dont go to school right now um my dream job is to be a psychologist laughter um im not a psychologist but what would make me decide to do that is um uh having lived um through some challenges like this um having lived through some traumas um but ive always had an interest in it um since junior high of um uh im very interested in people and um in human interaction and human connection and um the betterment of of uh of those things um bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their challenges chall uh personal uh challenges um uh so thats thats sort of um it in a nutshell um i think im someone whos um i can be very outgoing um and sort of um a warm and friendly presence very um easily but i think on o on on the exterior um but i think im shy and i challenge it to do that i think at heart im shy um but uh but i i challenge myself completely cause i do love human interaction so i take those risks and and jump and those challenges uh the last time i interacted with somebody was laughter today if i if i think im understanding your question correctly oh no no eh i think im misunderstanding your question but i i interacted with rachel um i just im um continuously interacting with people take taking those risks uh very good um mm very good laughter um when was the last time i argued with somebody i actually cant remember it wasnt recent laughter i have to think about that i dont know yet let me think um uh im drawing a blank um i can only rememeber things um from when i was like twenty one laughter right now i cant think of anything contemporary right right now my mind is okay uh when i was younger yes um i lost um a relationship with my aunt and my uncle and my cousins um cause when i was twenty one im forty five um i um uh uh had a a disagreement with my aunt and um i said something that was uh critical of her and um she threw me out of their home and um uh let me back uh i apologized immediately and they let me back into their lives um and changed their minds um so i regret that um im assuming you mean um how did i feel when they asked me to um never uh be in their lives again and to leave um uh shattered soul shattered heart shattered well that that was my family that was um the the good side of my family theres um uh uh the majority of my family fa they were they were the the loving aspect of my family um the rest of my family is very cruel and um like very abusive um i dont have any relationship with my family at all like the since i was um uh twenty one since my aunt and uncle um uh disowned me i guess is the right word estranged yeah um gosh um im drawing a blank just bear with me for one second um something i could um erase um laughter i cant even get it to my memory um uh as an example um uh i was injured and i wish i could get uh that away from my memory yeah um i was injured in um the emergency room scrubbedentry doing um i went in for food poisoning um i was ordered to go in um by a doctor um i had collapsed and i was ordered to go into the er for as i said food poisoning and i came out um injured with a neurological syndrome i was injured with a um uh what do you call it um uh intraveneous procedure um and now i have um rsd reflex sympathetic dystrophy and it the scene in the emergency room was um it was a an out of control scene there was a problem with the procedure and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake um eh and it was extremely excruciating um it was a a crisis and so um every time i think about the injury and it was uh disfiguring i got disabled um for f i uh got disabled for it uh disabled permanently um from it i was also um uh disabled from my employment for a quite amount of quite a given amount of time as well and and it i have residual um physical trauma from it and disfigurement and um severe disability disabil disability limited um um functionality uh with my right my im righthanded uh with my right hand and arm thank you i dont even know what that is um i you know i i really i apologize cause i cant really probably give you the uh most suitable answer um uh im guessing it had something to do with um  my cat um and her um her xxx urgent uh um uh what do you call it um hurt she was in intensive care veterinary care and im sure it had something to do with that um but other than that i would say um i had uh choosing my life path whether scrubbedentry um and uh i was admitted um to that program or whether i was gonna go um to um art school for four years um and i had to pick a life direction but uh thats not a traumatic situation um so i i dont know how best to answer your question i cant um i have um severe nightmares laughter and i have um nocturnal um  uh panic attacks and i also have physical illness on top of it and im in excruciating pain yes yes yes uh theyre triggered by the injury that i told you um theyre triggered by my family um theyve th how theyve treated me what um theyve said to me what theyve done to me um theyre triggered by um what else um my um my physical um illness um not my injury only but my physical um illness as well um so yes um i feel very ill and feel so fatigued very ill and very fatigued um when i dont sleep and get enough sleep um uh my anxiety level i believe is up and um im susceptible to feeling distressed um so yeah yes um three years ago um my m my most recent um diagnosis and in two thousand and one as well uh yes um three years ago and um when i was um twenty years old um the my background my childhood um from my family of origin um and their um uh uh you know the abuse that i um went through uh and their ultimate um uh uh whats the word um rejection of me and uh estrangement um that was the first uh reason um no i stopped six months ago sigh um why did i stop um im just taking a break laughter im gonna continue yes very much its helped tremendously um i think it helps with anxiety it helps with um um it helps inspire um create inspiration it helps um um uh feeling connected um it helps to create um what i ultimately um my goal is to um give myself a voice and um um uh it helps to to do d to uh it i its part of that process um it also helps um to understand myself um to learn about myself um and eh theres just so many benefits its i ill stop right there theres many more mhm um the last time i felt really happy it was a was a really long time ago um it was before my illness um and it was in nineteen ninety seven um the onset of my illness was in july of ninety seven so it was um before that laughter yes um i was um in a very good place um in terms of my career um um in terms of um uh my just my relationships and um everything was just sort of at its best um uh career relationships um personal um uh fulfillment um sort of um as well um i was very active and and doing uh very many things that were meaningful to um build a life um and i was um in the process of um uh just in the in i in the planning stages of my life but also very accomplished at at the same time so it was just things were just going very well and um i just really liked uh the just where my life was at it was just in a really good place in many ways mhm um i wish i could change about myself um my anxiety um i wish i could change about myself um my agoraphobia my ptsd um meaning my trauma um and um uh what else um um my insecurity uh as far as um uh just um with w with other people in the sense that im always trying to make sure that um that i dont do something that that um hold on one second im just trying to make sure that um i dont do anything thats um offensive to them or insults them um or uh is disrespectful um and i i feel like im overly um cautious about that and um it it it kinda becomes um an anxiety unto itself um so i i definitely think that that would be beneficial uh to change um the other thing id like to change about myself is i wish i could feel um and also depression id like to change that about myself i wish i could feel better um i wish i didnt feel um uh so um uh i didnt wish i didnt have the burden that i do of um my family um of not having one um and uh what else um i wish i didnt have my illness and the physical um excruciating pain that im in uh so those are some things um and i also wish that um and this is um a a byproduct of ptsd i wish that i didnt have um uh the the symptomology of ptsd um cause that definitely um affects ones complete com complete the complete life like eh a lot their affects their life uh completely um and i i wish i was more articulate and i wish i was um someone who was wellspoken and someone who is wellwritten um but theres many theres many more um uh things that i wish i could change about myself to improve myself so many more sigh um im not sure uh sniffle maybe to um not be so trusting um i trusted um i trusted some medical professionals that um you know again created the injury and um you know were theres a uh whats the word theres an expectation and a sort of a demand to just blindly trust um the medical profession um and sniffle um dont ask questions and just sort of um you know and if and not to trust your own self your own um your own instincts um or intuition um and so i would i wouldve told myself to be a little more careful um i guess if thats useful to your question sniffle um what did i really enjoy um you know i cant think of anything specific um but um i know it would have to do um with either reading or um connecting with someone on a meaningful level sniffle im most proud of um my compassion um my um my uh empathy and caring about people um despite um i mean im proud of it anyways but um also particularly sniffle um i come from a um an environment thats the opposite um a background and um i wasnt taught that sniffle um but i really do care about people and um im i guess im most proud of that im also proud of my um career accomplishments um and my um tenacity um my fierce fie my fierce tenacity to succeed um sniffle and uh you know just um also to get um the strength it takes to get through um the injury uh to live with it and to live with the illness um that i live with the physical illness um so i i think that would be it sniffle yes okay youre welcome bye
synch yeah im okay with it uh i feel i feel pretty good little l little nervous because ive never done anything like this before thats why laughter yeah from ohio cincinnati yeah uh two months ago two and a half months uh was just looking for just wanted to be in a new environment oh yeah im ecstatic very happy uh it took a few weeks just to get adjusted cause i didnt know anyone an the weather is probably the best thing yeah and uh i mean other than that its pretty much the same as everywhere else ive been theres nothing i dont really real really like about la its just you know just the weather is the best part of it yeah uh i like to travel somewhat uh i havent traveled a lot in my life but over the past uh year and a half ive done done quite a bit of traveling just seeing different places different people new people new faces new places uh sigh lets see last well last summer i spent the uh summer in cleveland sniffle doing uh urban farming uh in the city yeah and uh i stayed at a hostel the first hostel in cleveland scrubbedentry and i was uh doing a program with the uh scrubbedentry and it was basically we would go to different urban farms throughout the city and volunteer about bout twenty twenty five hours a week so yeah really a spur of the moment type of thing um wanted to try something different something id never done before and farming is one of those things that you know most people would never try cause of a you know cause of a certain stigma that comes along with it uh and you know i just thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that yeah what in the uh uh mm urban farming or in general in urban farming uh i dont know i guess uh i dont know just just the overall experience just going you know eating uh going to the farmers markets and eating all the fresh food and just seeing the difference in you know how fresh natural food taste eh you know as opposed to the food you buy in a grocery store yeah yeah it is really is uh i was i took two semesters of uh college and i was undecided so i was just taking general classes my dream job huh i guess my dream job would to be ss anything that involves invol uh i dont have like a specific dream job but anything that involves nature just being outside uh i would like to uh i wouldnt mind being like a like a forest ranger or something like that just as long as i you know yeah consider myself more shy uh i dont i dont know why laughter its just the way it is uh huh i read um listen to music uh i draw watch movies stuff like that yeah i think im pretty good at it i think thi yeah deep breath wow uh yeah i cant remember the last time i had an argument with someone i dont know sigh makes sounds with mouth again i dont know because i dont dwell on things that happened in the past yeah laughter mm maybe whether or not to come to california i guess that was a hard decision well i dont know ive been thinking about it you know moving to a new place for a long time and sigh i guess the hardest part of the decision was thinking whether whether or not i would be secure or not you know what i mean um just going to a new place where you dont know anyone uh its kinda uh you really dont know whats gonna happen so uh there was a lot of uh you know fear in that in that decision of should i go to a place where i dont know anyone i dont im not familiar with the area you know only only perception ever had ha that i have of this area is you know what ive seen on in media media and tv so you know eh yeah guess that was hardest hardest decision deci decision that i can think of yeah eh guess so uh nothing absolutely nothing yeah uh nothing i dont feel guilty about anything uh relationship with my family uh im not really close to my family um i guess the person im closest to is my mom but you know i dont you know i dont i never really talk to her much uh i dont really know my dad that well so you know makes clicking sounds with mouth whistling softly whistling softly uh i guess my grandmother yeah she yeah shes uh shes very um xxx how should i say it uh shes very shes a thinker i put it like that like shes very insightful so um yeah i look to her for a lot of advice because shes been through a lot through a lot in her life and i feel like she you know shes been through a lot so she understands a lot so eh you know shes a very positive influence very easy uh maybe unsure i would say because right now i really dont know what direction i wanna go in with my life and theres been a lot of confusion with that um but you know its not its not something that overly affects me but you know its always a thought in the back of my mind it feels feel feels like somehow maybe im running out of time and i know thats not like thats not xxx thats not a realistic thought because i dont see how you could ever run out of time but yeah i guess yeah just general not knowing what i want but i know like how do i cope with that how do i cope with that i uh i dont know i just do a lot of thinking a lot of soul searching its not hard i mean i mean im its xxx like i cant say its hard because its one of those things that i feel like its necessary and you know certain things in life you just youre forced to face so its harder to i think its harder to avoid those type of things yeah no no no uh xxx today when i talked when i uh talked to my friend earlier yeah how would my best friend describe me uh i guess he would say im quiet uh uh guess he would describe as a nice guy uh guess insightful mm uh goofy and yeah oh i dont really think like that no ten or twenty years ago uh guess i would tell myself to stick with what what stick with what i love hmm uh i did uh acting workshop in um scrubbedentry yeah i dont know its always al always been an interest of mine and i decided why not you know just try it see how you like it what am i most proud of like an event or a an accomplishment i guess i pride myself on being independent mm yeah bye
synch yes im okay with this im pretty good feeling a little tired but uh feeling pretty good for the most part um redondo beach yep i like the beach i like the mountains i love how you could go surfing in the morning go snowboarding in the day um i like to go hiking up in these mountains santa monica mountains to be exact i dont like the traffic i dont like the congestion of people here and i dont like the price of o the cost of living in specific areas uh ive been trying to actually um last year was the summer of really road tripping and getting out there with my girlfriend um were looking to go to costa rica and hopefully to south america this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip down the south see some of the southern states but uh ive been to canada ive been to mexico and ecuador and been to various states here and there trying to get out there i love meeting new people i love experiencing new things trying different diffing different foods that are native to that local area and its just part of the journey i just i love exploring this you know this planet we call earth um just recently we went to seattle and canada with a couple friends and uh it was gorgeous we uh flew into seattle and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and headed over to vancouver canada and saw british columbia and boy was it gorgeous just very lush beautiful trees the uh the climate was nice the ocean was right there it was people were great it was just a fun trip all around yeah deep breath sigh one of my most memorable sigh memorable experiences was probably the uh the trip we took to colorado last summer and uh me and my girlfriend flew into denver and we didnt really have a plan we knew we knew of a couple people who were living there and um just the day before we had to uh contacted them and telling em were coming in the area and they were just showed great hospitality they picked us up at the airport let us crash at their place for a couple days we even let us use their car to explore the state and go to wyoming and see the the neighbors to the north it was just a great trip great people and it was just everything worked out very well just every day was there was something new and fun to do yeah i uh i studied business management and uh economics right now um ive always wanted to own my own business and i figured management be a a good uh foundation to build on and uh learn more about so i decided to go into management just to see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and um and then economics is just to just for long term investments i really wanted to start earning some stocks and etfs and mutual funds and start buidling my portfolio up so i figured economics would be a great way for a long term investment financially so thats why i did my economics yeah im really stoked it was one of the best decisions probably of my my life yeah i consider myself more outgoing im im pretty friendly i dont mind to open up to people and stuff sigh i like to be outside like to go hiking i like to go um working out at the gym but i mostly like to be outdoors i i love nature and just to be outside just just puts me at ease from pretty good for the most part im pretty mellow chill guy and when i do get angry here and there i uh it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before i know it i just it just blows over i dont tend to hold on to things or stay angry and hold grudges just cause theres no need to lifes too short for all that um see i cant even remember the last time i argued with anybody i have no idea probably when my uh my brother and my girlfriend got in a little little argument uh like two birthdays ago and its been awkward kinda ever since um i wish i wouldve just handled it right then and there rather than it letting it just stretch out as long as it has been its just awkward for both parties i wish i just wouldve communicated with both of them and told em to you know set their differences aside and lets just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution but now its just awkward yeah it does the hardest decision ive ever had to make man thats a toughy i dont think ive had too many tough decisions to really say the hardest decision ive ever had to make um maybe not moving to colorado for my undergrad two three years ago was a little tough just cause i kinda think what if but other than that nothing has really been too tough in my life that was really that hard of a decision i dont really feel guilty about anything pretty good person i think and for the most part i couldnt think of anything something i could wish i could erase from my memory um nothing really to be honest i i love all my memories theyre usually positive for the most part i know thats kinda weird for somebody to say but ive lived a pretty good life and im happy yeah uh its cool um im pretty independent for the most part so when i do see em here and there its it we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month but uh when i see em its its good you know i like to say hi and show em i love em still and its not that i dont mean to like not contact em they could always contact me but uh its good for the most part i guess as a young adult mm my girlfriends family uh theyve been very positive in my life uh if it wasnt for them i think id be in a different direction just cause in high school i didnt really care about higher education i didnt care about really thinking long term and uh just seeing them th them and what their family does and how they think differently like with your higher education and how to get somewhere in life and the if you do these things this is what it could lead to and theyve been very successful they own their own uh accounting practice and seeing that influenced me to achieve higher in life yeah its pretty easy for the most part i just close my eyes and wake up in the morning im tired sometimes im could sense that im a little drained and uh maybe get a little groggy here and there and thats it feeling pretty good for the most part a little stressed out just cause finals are uh next week and uh i really really wanna do well and just you know close out this last semester and i graduate in two weeks and um for the most part thats thats the only thing im really nervous about but for the most part im really excited im looking forward to going to maui for a week after graduation im fired up im fired up to see what the future holds where we gonna live l me and my girlfriend gonna live and what other trips are planned for the summer im just im excited to be done with school for a little while yeah i have never been diagnosed with ptsd ive never been diagnosed with depression sigh the last time i felt really happy was probably seeing my girlfriend graduate a couple days ago she had uh just graduated from nursing school on monday and uh to see her walk across stage and stuff just cause weve been together for six years and seeing her go through the nursing program for five and its just seeing all the ups and downs its really good to see somebody just strive through and achieve what they want to achieve and just made me really proud of her yeah probably outgoing friendly positive vibes all around adventurous loves sports team player knows how to be a leader here and there and uh gets a little outspoken sometimes no not really for the most part no not really just be a little more motivated i used to be so motivated and right now im just maybe cause im just done with school and im over it that i just dont feel as motivated but i just i wanna be more motivated and determined right now and thats not im not going that way right now so mhm no biggie sigh oh man i couldnt cant really think of a time i went caving two weeks ago that was a lot of fun uh we went up to sequoia national park and uh i went caving with a for an rtm class its like this uh recreational tourism management class and caving was an elective and our professor was like a world renowned cave specialist and he took us to these various caves in uh sequoia and just me and these strangers or my classmates and becoming really good friends at the end was a lot of fun and rappelling down into caves climbing back up going through different rooms and chutes it was a lot of fun that was yeah ten or twenty years ago id probably say just stay more focused on school a little less on the social aspects and uh kinda stick with one sport just to see how far that could get ya um sigh sometimes not playing hockey through uh through middle school and hockey sometimes someti i mean through middle school and high school sometimes and um and thats pretty much it now im proud sigh that uh im really proud that im graduating getting my bachelors and im looking to get a full time job i work at a law firm now so i have something going for me  um im really proud to be a motivated and determined person long term wise w long term thinking wise im a wellrounded person and i really wanna explore the world so im kinda proud that i opened my eyes to that and now i have different perspectives and really have a open mind to people and rather than judging em you know its liberty why not let em do what they want and uh im really proud to just be finally getting my bachelors and hopefully going for my mba in a couple years for sure bye

a parking lot ill ill confront them on that sometimes um mightve been with my sister um it had to do with um im not sure of the topic but um whatever she was saying wasnt right and we got in an argument it it sounds childish about who was right you know cause she thinks shes always the smarter one cause shes older uh sometimes its frustrating cause its like its a no win situation she just

being a single parent its just you always have somebody to bring you joy i enjoy always doing things with my daughter um its just about making a lot of sacrifices and just always its brings me so much joy being a parent well um my parents when i was younger they lived apart so my mom i dont know im im a much better parent cause im more interested about what my child wants to do im involved in her life her every step just im really fully involved my parents wasnt really that involved you know they had a drug problem so it just i had to mature a lot faster than a lot of other kids so it was um just my parents and um their drug addiction i wish i could erase that from my memory um now i cope with them well but um when i was growing up it just was rough it was very rough had to do a lot of things on my own um they wasnt involved in my decisions in life you know i just i didnt know how to really grow up and be a kid and which way to go or anything it just was like i was in a world by myself yeah oh its very easy i sleep well every night i can sleep any time i sleep very well um a little sad but most of the time im very happy im just not happy with where i am in my life right now um not really i really i try to think very positive and try to do whatever i can every day to look for work and just stay positive and focused no i havent no i havent um the last time i felt very

day she start just um being very negative and just talking about me like we were enemies and everything and it didnt really make me feel too bad about myself but it just made me pick my friends very wisely yeah just being friends with certain people that dont have positive things going on with themselves or just dont it just when i notice things about people that should determine whether i wanna be their friend or not you know they might have bad qualities or just some bad habits they might smoke cigarettes or drink and i should notice that thats a red flag and i shouldnt be these people friends laughter yeah um to stay in school stay positive stay focused and surround myself with good positive people and just stay on the right track well i went um to a friends house that i havent seen since childhood and they it was just a lot of people over there and they had a barbecue and everything and i really enjoyed seeing my old friends that i didnt see in a long time and just being

time yeah um im proud that i did get my ged i did graduate and i do wanna be somebody and im very proud that i wanna be a better parent than my parents thank you laughter goodbye
synch yes im doing well thank you from los l los angeles mm sports outdoor sports mainly surfing uh snowboarding mountain biking rock climbing traffic yes experiencing different cultures uh well uh i love going to mexico and uh eh its so much diffferent from california and western culture so to speak i know mexico is a western civilization but uh the uh the level of of entertainment and the level of education is so much different that uh eh theyre like two different worlds traveling you mean uh i would have to say going to an island off the coast of figi the name is tavarua and its a very small island you can walk around it in thirty minutes thirty or forty minutes and uh its a place where you go to go surfing and it it is an incredible uh visually incredible and uh experientially incredible place i studied biology uh i was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and uh he wanted me to become a medical doctor also not at all im working in areas of business now yes i am my dream job would be to be a missionary yes my fathers initial objective when he became an md was to become a missionary and uh hes a very generous person and i think i am too i i i got that from him uh hereditarily but uh i would like to help people eh and i dont think being a doctor is helping people i really dont i think its uh disingenuous to say youre helping people while youre stuffing wads of cash into your pocket i would like to be uh building people homes and uh helping them find fresh water sources things like that if i could afford to travel to remote places like that i exercise i think im pretty good at it uh uh i think im pretty effective at it it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend and it was about her uh lack of consideration um i felt frustrated hmm a situation which i wished i could handle differently um i eh in my later years i would say eh i dont have many regrets in my younger years i used to uh be snubbed by people and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldnt say anything i would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior i would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings ive learned that that is so wrong and so in the probably the last fifteen to twenty years i have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someones actions right away and that uh takes care of the anger immediately yes it i it depends what you mean by trouble uh i think eh all the way around once you take the beginning benning the beginning to the end uh it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble uh going back it would be to not to pursue uh medicine like my father wanted we argued uh at length for many months and years about this and uh finally i prevailed and uh i didnt go to i didnt go that route uh but that was probably the most uh uh difficult period in my life mm there was a time when i wished i could erase a female interactions uh girlfriends and and their uh betrayals uh but now i realize that keeping those memories make me who i am today and and dealing with them defines who i am today uh my parents are deceased i had very good relationships with my parents uh im very thankful for that um even though my father was somewhat of a uh hardhanded uh and draconian laughter person uh we came to an understanding well before he died and uh my brothers i get along great with my younger brother but my older brother has issues he has uh psychological issues and they th they continue to plague him and to affect me also just just knowing that hes going through uh turmoil uh well i guess i really dont cope with it because um hes clinically depressed and he has suicidal tendencies and uh hes not working hes very highly educated and he uh well he doesnt talk to me and uh his family is very abusive towards him its an not a happy relationship for his family yes you know i would have to say my father my father is my hero hes my uh model hes my uh archetype for what a man should be uh hes he was unimpeachably honest and kind uh yet on the other hand he was uh he had high expectations of me and my two brothers eh usually once my head hits the pillow i am dead asleep like a log but lately ive been having uh just last night i couldnt sleep i woke up at two and i have a feeling its because of a diagnosis of cancer that i received one month ago um xxx i with my own personal uh methods of handling stress i im okay im probably ninety percent okay that ten percent comes from uh eh an unsuredness about the future about whether i will survive this or not not really no never never oh i was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking uh i always experience joy when im exercising at a very high level of exertion funny jovial uh uh intelligent a perfectionist hmm eh thats no ones asked me much about that um maybe uh is to submerge my uh hedonistic self i look at once again my father fills my consciousness he was the ultimate um uh deferrer of gratification he put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that and thats what made him the uh selfmade man that he was whereas i am looking always for the present um how i feel now and its difficult for me to uh slog through a a mile full of uh crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away deep breath it would be my exboss and he started using at my last day of work when he fired me he started using uh a lot of profanity toward me and eh i turned to him and i said you cannot talk to me that way and he continued to use more profanity until uh i objected to it again and thats when he fired me and uh that thats still in my mind and that occurred a year and a half ago mhm anything i regret uh yeah i regret not getting married and having kids sure i suppose i could uh eh but i think that that wouldve robbed me of the many opportunities i had and i took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because thats what i enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness because the united states is not the end of the world it is i eh once you get to travel you find out that we are not we do not have the highest uh level of uh of living in the whole world other people think that were the only ones that think that and i disagree mm thats a good one i would say laughter i would say to just enjoy life because you never know when its going to end and i think ive done that and uh i may be coming to an end soon uh with this diagnosis of cancer so i think ive done im im happy with my life thus far i was giving a rock climbing lesson i have a uh part time job of instructing rock climbing and many of these people have never done it before and uh they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so that was very gratifying to me deep breath i would say sigh my devotion to the environment uh i wasnt always an environmentalist but uh i have been uh vocal in the cause of uh uh being a um uh a steward of the environment because today theyre a lot of peoples people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic uh things like that and i stand up and i uh have been on tv and on uh youtube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment youre welcome goodbye

a conversation about it they got mad and then i got mad and we got mad um i felt like i wasnt being heard or listened to and i felt like we werent able to have a real dialogue so um because we couldnt have a dialogue i felt like no one was listening to me totally um makes sound with mouth i uh i i um no regrets no laughter um laughter i guess hmm i dont know if there is one i mean im sure there is but uh one time i was driving behind someone and they well they cut me off and i think itd just been one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago um it was just one of those days where i just didnt want or i just it had been a frustrating day and when this person cut me off and i almost got in an accident with them i just followed them to their parking spot and actually i had honked at them and they they flipped me off and so it just really really got under my skin that someone would cut me off and almost cause an accident and then uh and then flip me off so i i followed them to the spot and i asked i said miss why did you flip me off when you cut me off and and she said oh you know im ive had a rough day i dont need your attitude and her daughter was with her and i told her well youre not really setting a very good example for your daughter and you know i didnt need to be petty like that but i just i wanted to be i guess ooh sigh mm look at you going deep laughter um oh i guess the hardest decision was coming out to my mom uh telling her i was gay i mean it wasnt hard cause it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom was very conservative and she she had trouble accepting it and it it took awhile but once she did you know everything was better and i knew it would be but it was just hard in the moment to you know tell her something she didnt wanna hear okay um when i was a little kid my um my grandfather found our dog run over on the on the road and he uh scrubbedentry and brought it in and i think i remember as a kid just uh like seeing death like that really just threw me off and uh frightened me and uh it was just one of those moments that i i guess i wish i hadnt been there for because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad and uh it was just one of those moments i guess you need as a kid but i didnt really wanna experience like loss like that in your face yeah my relationship with my family is pretty good um were probably not as close as most but uh we you know we always we dont talk often but we talk with love and we always love each other when we see each other um my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me to uh you know pursue my dreams and not to let the little things get me down so im glad i had her usually its easy um sometimes its not um well ive been between jobs recently i start a new job uh next week but while ive been off uh while i havent been working um i tend to like my body wants to stay up later and later and later and im trying not to like fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like two or three and getting up at like eleven so i keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or twelve thirty and i just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half when i should be i should sh i should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like nine but still wanna stay up i guess uh a little scatterbrained like today im a little scatterbrained cause uh i i tried to go to sleep early again and i ended up tossing and turning and so sigh scatterbrained laughter um well since ive had a lot of time on my hands like i dont usually have this much time on my hands so sometimes it can be frustrating because um you dont know what to do with it when youre not working i guess um but yeah i think that answers the question um i just that maybe a little more absentminded than usual just lately with uh the not working thing no mm mm um a couple days ago when i got my new job laughter when i got hired um outgoing listening uh attentive um fun loyal i think i hope um i wish that i uh i probably wish that i looked better i wish i had more hair up here mm losing it a little bit uh probably wish i was a little skinnier this this girdles pretty tight laughter and um you know sometimes i wish i had more money but nothing too drastic im okay yeah oh um mm hmm when i was a little kid i was uh i was the fat f i was the fat kid and um gosh i remember i was like i was going into high school and it was like the second day and i remember this guy came up to me and was um like he was like pretty nice to me i thought and i didnt realize hed like this is like out of a movie right like he had put bandaids on my back that said like im a fat cow and said like uh like yeah like just a bunch of mean stuff and i didnt know and i walked around with it for like half an hour i heard people laughing and i didnt get it and then finally this girl just came up to me and was like hey theres like bandaids on your back that say all these mean things and then she just walked away she didnt like help me take em off and i remember like i couldnt get em i was trying to find em and then um i just remember like putting my head in my locker and like i didnt want anyone to see me cry so i just like put my head in my locker and like pretended like i was looking at stuff in my backpack but really i was you know the crying fat kid who couldnt get the mean stickers off his back mm yeah anything um probably yeah sharp inhale um you know i would xxx i would try to keep i would try to let myself know to to look at things positively and to not like worry what other people think about you i think i spent too much time as like a adolescent worrying what people thought of me and as i got older i didnt care as much and i started enjoying life a lot more so uh i went to coachella its a music festival it was three days with all of my friends and my boyfriend and we uh we danced and we went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and

synch yes thanks im well thank you how are you i grew up in oklahoma mhm um i moved to la about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west we on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here my hometown not very often um most m most of my familys moved away so i visit them but i dont actually get back to oklahoma much sniffle oklahomas very different um uh las a lot more exciting theres a lot more um uh to do here and um uh the ocean obviously is very nice so um you know thats a good question i um i wanted to try something new and ive always loved the beach and i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought la might be a good place for me to come very its probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made laughter pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural it seemed like a good fit um i just really like it here oh its great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or um you know hang out with friends and its just its kind of like being on vacation all the time its really nice mm i studied philosophy and um political theory and government and did a little bit of english literature on the side um it kind of just happened naturally i think uh i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different areas and i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that um not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate grad with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities um but i dont actually um use my philosophy background very often laughter um you know i have actually studied to become a success coach um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice aspect of of doing that but id really like to work with other o with other people so not just students um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams um id say it it its fairly hard um in the sense that um you know it can be challenging for people to actually be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it its also a challenge because making a living at it uh requires charging people money laughter so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too um im definitely on the shyer side im an introvert so um im pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people im very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and im not as engaged and i think that um is something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if theyre not introverted um so i id say and its also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers laughter pretty good i think um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time not really um it can be a challenge when im driving laughter but other than that no hmm hmm im not sure it wouldve probably been a discussion over politics and it probably wouldve been a friendly argument um probably with one of my liberal friends so but i actually cant remember the specific time laughter sniffle mm i meditate um i do that almost every day um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts so thats nice mm well let me think about that for a minute sigh hmm laughter im having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i im sure there are plenty of things um just nothing comes to mind um sniffle sigh hmm okay im sorry laughter hmm well this isnt exactly an event its its a dream and its not a particularly um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but um i do have it sometimes probably more often than id like so i wouldnt be upset if it you know if i didnt have it um and its just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um its usually me in school somewhere at the end of the semester havent gone to class taking the exams know im going to fail and you know really unhappy about it wishing why didnt i study and attend class the way i should have um which actually wasnt really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and its kinda frustrating and im not exactly sure why i mean i know why but i dont know what it applies to because its not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so no i dont think so um at least not not that im aware of sniffle i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sisterinlaw and a nephew and they live on the east coast and i love my nephew hes eight hes adorable and um i when i used to live there when he was younger um spent a lot of time with them and since ive been in california and particularly in the last year ive spent a lot less time visiting them so for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back in i at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last la the last time id seen them um and that i felt bad about because we really enjoy each others company and he um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back so thats um that makes me feel bad sometimes mm um well i have a brother im very close to him hes younger and um hes like four four and a half years younger hes married um i have a nephew um my both of my parents have passed away so its just the two of us and we have a large extended family but were not that close with them um with most of them um on my fathers side theres one brother um and hes married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mothers side there are sigh five fi four or five other kids um most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then but you know were not that close with our extended family so um id say well um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences scrubbedentry when i came out to california um i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and um we just established this really strong friendship and shes kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now shes moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um but uh were going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but shes been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didnt really know anybody um and it you know since im an introvert its not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know i think she kinda gets me so its a lot of fun to hang out with her and and thats been nice im a sleeper laughter so its pretty easy um sometimes my you know depending on how long ive been awake clears throat i can be wound wou a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and thats very helpful um and i can sleep uh you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles so um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination um i usually dont wake up in the middle of the night or at least if i do i dont remember it so um well i dont do actually dont sleep very well when i travel s one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit because i work for a company thats back east so i work from home most of the time but then i travel like one week a month and when i travel ill take the redeye um and then ill visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i dont sleep that much its not that i um sleep poorly or badly its just that i um dont have that much time to sleep and the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay but usually the second day is not very good um so i get a lot more tired uh and its harder to concentrate and um i dont know it just feels like more of a struggle i would say good um summer is a little l is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so im a little um i i dont know kn know if stressed is the right word but im you know a little anxious about um everything going well this summer but um in general im feeling pretty good not really i cant i cant think of anything um there th there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um and i hike with friends and um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated um because i didnt really exercise when i was there and id gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now im struggling to try and get back in the routine and its not going as well as i would like its okay thank you no no hmm well scrubbedentry hes a lot of fun and um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and were actually doing a book club now so were gonna skype and um maybe ill get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun hmm sigh well shed probably say that i know how to have fun but that i can be serious and um that i you know care about others uh and that im loyal and im not sure what else um i think those those are probably the main things sniffle um i wish i had more selfdiscipline laughter so um i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar i wish that i would not procrastinate because ive gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging um and i wish that i um xxx i dont know uh i think i wish that i was in a relationship so probably those things mm hmm so at the last organization i used to work at i had a boss and she was i dont feel like she was um i dont think we were very compatible um and she uh used to push my buttons or so i thought and so um one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didnt have the answer um and he was upset about something and it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was um but it wasnt i ive been a manager for many years um and i have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with people peo with staff members and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel um you know incompetent or at least thats the the way that i felt about it and um i did you know i tried to be very calm and said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but uh after that our relationship wasnt really the same and i ended up staying st uh leaving there to go back to the old organization that id worked for not that long afterwards because i just didnt really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me or after we had that interaction so laughter so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had read it back then which is um when you think about buying something instead of thinking uh oh heres this beautiful coat its a hundred dollars i want it im gonna buy it it uh dont think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that because thats effectively what your money could do if you didnt spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and um i think ive been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago sigh probably scrubbedentry um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them so sigh lets see well uh in i it wasnt really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore uh and i got to fly first class um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadnt been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too sure thank you bye
synch yes uh good thanks the east coast for work uh rarely i prefer it out here uh i its um not as nice as the lifestyle out here i like the weather better and uh just a lot of things about living here its my favorite city so uh somewhat um but i mostly whats that um just um i like to go to france a lot i like the food there and um just the uh lifestyle the shopping that sort of thing uh art history and marketing uh well um i became interested in high school and i thought it was a good um classical education uh and um i interned at andy warhols magazine when i was in high school and so that scrubbedentry hmm yes yes uh eh im pretty happy with what im im doing i do um consulting so i write marketing plans that sort of thing um its can be fairly hard about writing a marketing plan um uh i dont know its hard its hard to um laughter to talk to someone whos about it whos not in marketing it it requires just um a knowledge of uh you know how its how it how its done and it it takes uh several months to to do one so um well i guess im i originally kind of shy but um i i become more outgoing just cause of work and stuff um i like to exercise uh i i do um hiking with my dogs we walk up up and down a hill a couple times is it good uh i dont remember um i dont know nothing comes to mind mm um sometimes i dont i dont clean my car it might get lots of dog hair in it and i feel bad when i i should always stay on top of that just getting to the car wash and stuff uh well i had a conflict with my brother and so um i had to decide to have an estrangement from him and that makes the most sense and that was a a somewhat difficult decision but just because of his angry behavior it wasnt it wasnt that difficult but um you know it was wa it was somewhat difficult because i i loved him very much so um im not close to my family so um but i dont really have one um i have a a japanese friend uh oh i think the sensor came off i have a a japanese friend im im uh very close with shes like my kind of a my m my mother and um scrubbedentry uh i just met them socially um scrubbedentry uh i dont know nothing comes to mind talking to experimenter talking to experimenter talking to experimenter talking to experimenter talking to experimenter talking to experimenter um pretty easy cause i keep a regular schedule um just jus just kind of tired maybe a little bit irritable uh good um well im recovering from ptsd so um i sometimes feel the the ptsd and then ill ill take a medication for that no its just uh its just left over of the im still sti i still have the stress from it im still being treated for it it i dont really have any um i prefer not to talk about it um in the past but its treated um five years ago uh i was i was just um very sad very depressed and so um i also had anxiety so i i went to to doctor and um they helped me and i did uh psychotherapy yeah for the ptsd though um i dont know i guess uh its just um just kind of supportive because be because of the issues i have with my family its its supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and um you know it just uh gives me good feedback and helps me to make good decisions that sort of thing i yeah i have nightmares about my family sometimes yeah thanks oh uh i i just try to uh sleep better i xxx i xxx i xxx before i go to sleep i sort of like um meditate a little bit to get to be calm and then hope that that will help i feel happy all the time pretty much like i my dogs make me happy and you know my life is really happy so mhm uh i guess you know as a a nice person im thoughtful um a good friend um sigh and happy fun person um i dont know i mean im in my forties now so im pretty happy with with myself my m you know my um you know uh ive ive done a lot of a lot of work on myself in in therapy and stuff so im pretty i wouldnt really change a lot im pretty happy with myself i mean not to sound conceited but im im pretty um happy with myself now uh well we that would that would be um my parents theyre very abusive so i dont d i d i dont talk to them anymore so laughter um any you know any times with them you know they they uh you know said sai did terrible things to me so i prefer not to talk about it uh lets see um well i just started reading a book i i like to read um cookbooks and i was just reading a book called um when french women cook and its about uh a womans relationship with different women and friends in different parts of france and the and the cooking and so im really enjoying that book mhm um i usually you know um get the grocery shopping done which i enjoy i really i really like doing the grocery shopping i go to a few places and and do a bit of cleaning and um uh just uh relax oh yeah i would wou i would say um to have better selfesteem cause i used to have very low selfesteem you know from being abused and so um you know i i wish id been happier ha happier in the past and you know its taken me a long time to become happy because um you know no matter what what i did whatever achievements i i was i was never happy in the past i was i was always you know struggling with being depressed i didnt di i didnt even know why and now you know i realize because of whatever events that it that it was from my parents from that um a relationship and so i my i what the advice would be to not um have a relationship that um is bad for you like sometimes estrangement is the best choice in an abusive relationship um just just j the way i live my life the way i treat people i think you know um you know i i believe it like your deeds are very important and i try to treat people in a good way and and i guess you know im im proud of you know with my work like decisions ive made that um that give me um you y you know a a a a uh a job that i i

ive been doing that for about uh three months now so yeah it is um almost too good at times laughter uh sometimes uh theres things that should be said that i that i dont um just because um you know its like youre opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example i got a problem with him but they dont have a problem with him necessarily cause he didnt do anything to them and uh ive had to deal with that in the past sort of a awkward social situation but um you know i make do um makes sound with mouth probably argued with uh the guitarist from my band uh we had a falling out were not gonna be in a band together i mean were still friends so at least theres that mm but um it was just basically about creative control of the project and how were gonna prioritize it in in our lives and uh you know we just our priorities werent the same and i got very upset so that was the end of that um sigh i felt good that it was definitive that it was you know a choice had been made on both parties uh also regretful that you know he didnt feel the way that i wanted him to feel about it which was excited about the project so the fact that he wasnt really in it kinda pissed me off um but i got over it um and you know i got some other people that are really really excited to be working with me you know even honored so you know im uh ima keep going thank you um sigh hmm i dont know i dont really i dont really have any regrets like that at the moment i cant really think of any um deep breath um when i was in high school i cheated on my girlfriend i didnt think it would mean anything at the time but i did it i i regret it but um you know xxx you know life happens you make some mistakes selfishness um being young and thinking it wouldnt matter um you know thinking you know you only live once and you know for eh it was probably for the best ultimately cause you know i love my current girlfriend and i would never do that to her so that was wa that was years ago but uh she was a nice girl she didnt deserve that so i regret it deep breath um shit geez um i guess uh whether to go to college or not cause uh i uh i had some projects going in la that i didnt really wanna shut off uh i i had a band going we had a manager um we were playing out a lot and i wasnt sure if i wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over and um i made the decision to go to school in santa cruz and and start a new life there for four years and it it was a difficult decision but im glad i did cause i met a lot of people a lot of people im still close with today that you know we work on stuff together and all that so its good i agree it is good laughter thank you laughter um maybe i wish i could forget getting spanked in the parking lot when i was four by a danish babysitter uh you know on the abuse scale its pretty low but it was somewhat humiliating and i i dont forget it so i have a pretty vivid picture of it and im im id be happier if it wasnt there its positive theyre supportive um they give me a hard time sometimes because they dont think that i keep things in perspective in terms of how im gonna support myself even though i do its just um you know i have a a more long range picture than they do and i have faith in myself and the creative projects that i make so yeah theres a bit of tension there just cause you know they expect certain things from me and i expect them as well but i just have a different way of going about it than they might prefer but theyre sweet people how do i cope with them uh i you know theyre lovely people at their core you know um cope with them cause i love them i just uh you know at times ill just uh go off on my own for a while and eh you know take a breather whatever you know xxx everyone makes you mad sometimes so deep breath challenging um sigh i just i try and it doesnt work um sometimes i have to take medication for it i have to take ambien something like that um yeah its difficult di im someone who sleeps in late so i always get at least six or seven hours if i have to wake up early for something um i get nauseous sometimes ill throw up in the morning um yeah ive had jobs where id wake up and you know vomit while im brushing my teeth its horrible it does suck um its kinda something im worried about you know i i kinda need to get some part time work while im not you know getting a steady pay flow for my music production so yeah sigh its pretty rough sigh got some stuff i need to get over im not really sure how just not feeling good getting nervous when you know theres something stressful like a stressful work environment or just something i that doesnt sit well with me like being in a you know a a rushed and you know stressful work environment it just um unless its about something that i care about you know like music or the arts its just very hard to to give a shit frankly like and you know i i try to psych myself into giving a shit and it just makes me sick you know maybe ill have a red bull or something and you know xxx my body doesnt want that in the morning it just i feel like my body rejects things and yeah okay ive been feeling okay very uh very reflective very contemplative you know theres gonna be some changes and theres gonna be some new people in my life some new people uh in my band um you know im gonna try to push myself but try to stay grounded at the same time cause you know i expect more from myself its just pissing me off when my get my you know i basically feel like im shitting all over myself my bodys shitting on me anyway just by being so um shitty laughter yeah no yes um i was diagnosed um about uh twelve years ago i havent been in therapy since um they gave me zoloft and i didnt like it it made me feel worse than i do in the shittiest moments i was telling you about it it uh it made me feel numb um i dont wanna feel numb i wanna feel everything even if it sucks being forced to it was a private school they thought i was acting up thought i was a uppity kid i think i was just being a kid so yes i do um well i havent been in in twelve years but i do think that it might be helpful for me in the future i thought you werent a therapist thats a typical therapist question right there laughter um well yeah i uh uh i i kinda wanna go back to therapy it might help might help me find some solutions maybe maybe its not a therapist i need maybe its a life coach i have no idea but ill be seeking help soon um yesterday i was watching a movie with my girlfriend and i looked over at her we smiled at each other and it was it was it was great yeah um very honest um sometimes brutally so but im a good guy i think that my friends all think im a good guy probably funny um openminded um i guess well its what im working on which is trying to improve my discipline and try to work through my body rejecting shittiness of the world laughter it gets better sigh um stay in shape it gets harder the longer you wait um dont give up on your dreams keep doing what youre doing my music youre welcome nice talking to you
synch yes im doing fine i was born in texas and i moved to california when i was three and grew up here in california yeah i was yes uh ive never been back there um dont have any relatives there dont have a reason to go back there um makes sound with mouth laughter well my my familys here thats one uh the weathers great uh the beaches and mountains are here all those things are very good uh the traffic which is probably probab probably most people say um its expensive to live here those are probably the top two uh recently ive traveled um well you get to see new places and and new people you get to learn more about other cultures and uh different ways people think oh uh at the end of march i went to ecuador for a week uh um i spent most of most of one day with with an ecuadorian who only speaks spanish and i speak very little spanish so we got um it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him i felt like a a little kid trying to you know say you know whats this whats this uh it was very humbling um you know just just seeing that you know when you dont when youre not able to communicate then that that can be very difficult im probably more of a shy person genetics i dont know why um im an electrician so i studied electrical construction ive also studied uh computer networking um it was i guess just uh kinda circumstances i needed the the the work i was doing wasnt providing for the family and i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursued that because of the the financial gain mm uh its given me a lot of opportunity but uh i dont think its what i what i wanna do for the rest of my life well im actually uh pursuing becoming a missionary uh my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall uh for four years and last year we we trained in north carolina for one year um and that was like theology and bible training um basically god put a um a desire in my heart to get beyond get beyond myself and and do something for other people to to go and and learn about another people their culture and to share the gospel with them well in my immediate family um im im married ive been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters and then um but i i have one older brother uh no sisters um so what what do you wanna know about my family um im really close with my wife and my daughters uh with my brother im not not real close partly because hes uh hes mentally handicapped um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old even though hes hes five years older than me so just kinda because of that dynamic it its hard to have a a close relationship with him but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents um id say my my youth pastor in high school he was a real real positive influence in me um just he has a he has a drive and a zeal for for pursuing the truth um and just uh studying the bible and and because of his influence that kinda put me on a path to wanting to study the bible um i think ive gotten better at it there have been times when you know ill ill get angry and uh you know it can just kinda really rule over me just the frustration and im the type of person that it takes me um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to to calm down again but ive ive learned um over time that really getting angry um and keeping that anger in doesnt it doesnt attack the other person or the thing that im angry at it just kinda attacks me and so really it its not a its not a good behavior to to keep so when whe when things anger me i try to uh like talk to the other person say you know this th this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it and and resolve it and come to a resolution um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem um sigh well a a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago um my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents and her parents had already left um eh we were just driving down to orange country area for this trip and my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed and but hadnt really in i in my eyes hadnt expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had and so when i was trying to meet those expectations she um you know i i didnt meet em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted um and kinda getting attacked for it so so then i i i started yelling at her and and we you know we had that conflict but then you know with wi within an hour or so we had kinda talked through and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was um are you asking the moment of during the conflict uh very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it in your body um part partly i the i guess the anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt f was feeling attacked and that came out as anger so i would think um yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger mm hmm hmm hmm i guess it was um deciding to go um to go to our training last year um i i felt that god had put on my heart that that this was something i was supposed to pursue um my wife didnt feel that way and i i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue and but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasnt supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart so i kinda relinquished r relinquished it um and i and i said to her you know im not gonna make you go um you know if if you wanna go then th then well go but if not then well well do something else well well look at at doing something else and not going uh and so that that was difficult for me cause uh you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss cause i felt deeply that thats what i was supposed to do um but then after i kinda gave that up then um then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so um so just kinda giving it up was wa was wa was difficult for me tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory um oh let me see im not sure um i dont know i i cant really think of anything very traumatic um that i would wanna erase but i i think you know good things and positive posi eh good things and bad things they all kinda shape who we are and so i i i cant think of anything that i would want to erase um usually usually its not too bad um are are you referring to on the the questionnaire where i said that i had trouble trou some trouble sleeping um the the job i work the the um kinda the the scheduling has shifted so i so lately ive been working some nighttime shifts or graveyard shifts so um coming home in the morning you know when its light then its been hard for me to sleep but it was it was mostly cause i was staying up so late because of work uh it pretty easy um when i when i dont sleep then i do get cranky uh i ive been feeling good lately no not really no no um hmm i dont know um cant think of anything that was kinda out of the ordinary but um yesterday we my wife and i took took our three th our our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest one um stayed with her grandma but we uh we took em to the park and they played and yeah so those th those are always happy times when we take the kids to the park um i i think hed say im a a family man that um im uh dependable that he can he can count on me um usually my my friend i end up doing um different work around the house for him cause im kind of a handyman so so in that way i i i think hed say im kinda dependable or someone he could go to for advice um i guess i would um i guess i would like to be able to um start conversations with people easier uh sometimes i have i have trouble just talking to people especially if theyre in a group if i if people are one on one then its its usually easier for me to talk to them but kinda talking to people in a group uh i wish i was a little better at that now if its okay what what i was gonna say right before that was that um uh if if im giving a speech or something to a large group i dont really have a problem with that but if its more interaction type thing then thats kinda difficult uh advice i wouldve given to myself ten or twenty years ago um probably wouldve been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life um thats about it think that would made that wouldve made the biggest difference in my life i think um well i have i have four kids and i hope im raising em right i hope that that um you know the mistakes that ive made i can kinda guide them through their their journey in life and i hope that they end up a little better for it than than me um yeah i just hope hope kinda through them that i can you know leave lea leave something worthwhile youre welcome goodbye
synch sure laughter mm good i guess new orleans louisiana uh two thousand five i used to go back often but not much anymore uh just things happened uh laughter uh well guess youre not programmed with this knowledge but uh katrina happened in two thousand five not really um hmm where to begin uh just las different culturally i have a different culture out here its just a different place um its its bike friendly louisiana isnt new orleans for that matter really isnt now theyre trying to be but it just it isnt that successful sigh the drivers theyre crazy mm not really kind of but not much anymore dont have the money kinda broke laughter just being able to go on an adventure um lets see i once went to comic con on a on a bicycle like on a a three wheel bike um and that that was pretty fun kinda scary and dangerous nearly got killed laughter it was scary laughter traveling or just in general hmm um i gotta say i gotta say we were we were heading out of um we were heading off the pch and going into um laguna and laguna has this really steep hill and on sundays its full of traffic and i i remember going down the the hill and my brakes werent working and i was trying to hit my brakes and trying to hit my brakes and they just they wouldnt click and i was like oh god and im im on a three wheel bike so im larger than most bikes and im like zipping in between like gridlock traffic going down a hill unable to brake and im going down and suddenly theres this car that veers right into mm essentially where im trying to go so i turn sharply in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic and then laughter looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any brakes and like not managing to keep my bike from rolling which is painful when your bike roles kinda hurts a lot so yeah yeah thats it laughter um various different things uh anthropology visual effects kinda weird but yeah um i just ive always had a fascination with film and i i think the way people do things and go about things is fascinating just as like the the mob mentality of people especially ooh dream job um huh i have no idea just a job i guess i consider myself more outgoing um you know i ive never been afraid of what people think of me like people xxx i i i like people i dont know im not im not afraid of what they think eh im more concerned with like the people i know and what they think of me i guess so being outgoing just doesnt really affect me eh um deep breath mumbling sigh uh i play video games listen to music um yeah read books i like reading books and drawing reading books drawing playing video games did i think of anything did i forget anything sleeping i like sleeping its fun uh mumbling not good laughter frequently laughter um sigh uh in high school i i shoved somebodys head through a locker um yeah yeah that thats not good dont ever shove someones head into a locker thats a great way to get suspended um i dont know yeah things like that just getting into fights sigh um like a serious argument um sigh uh i guess like xxx argument over over um uh i guess over like uh like viewpoints on like gun control and gun control laws i mean it was like yesterday evening eh it was it it was an argument about you know gun control regulation i mean it doesnt really affect me personally but that was like the last argument i got into that thats kinda what you specified i think ooh um uh my entire life um laughter uh mumbling sigh i have um about two years ago i broke up with like as everyone calls her my evil ex and um yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean uh eh sigh uh i think ive calmed down a lot since then like just as a person as a whole but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like went riding my bike for like a hundreds plus miles in a singular day and i was in a ton of pain like later in the evening i got home i was like oh god like i could barely walk um and yeah i i think running off and like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like eating too much and like just overeating cause i was depressed but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we didnt physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death deep breath sigh hmm um i dont think ive had a singular hard decision ive had ever had to make because my my biggest thing in life is dont you know dont regret dont regret the the the things you do just regret the opportunites youve missed and thats like had to come with me thats like had to ive had to like learn that in the past like two years like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept and to answer your question i think thinking about it the hardest decision ive had to make is id say probably probably to break up with my ex probably um xxx sigh ooh um sigh where do i begin sigh um my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word um she did some things that i wasnt entirely comfortable with um just to the the people around her and to me and i deep breath laughter you know they say youre supposed to give forgive people for making mistakes or doing things and i just i think there are some things you cant forgive people for no matter how hard you try and i think there are some things that once done that that cant be undone they just theyre theyre the way that they are and i think i think after what she did i i like i just xxx eh things just fell apart after that it just it it we mm despite us trying it just it didnt work out i mean i i i dont know i dont really wanna talk about exactly what happened oh geez oh man erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening um huh i dont sigh you know thats hard um katrina just the experience of katrina for starters um laughter my m my ex i i guess between those two its its kinda hard id id actually rather lean towards uh katrina cause that was just that that was not i mean i i guess you dont exactly know about it but um in two thousand five um uh this giant storm hit uh new orleans louisiana um killed a whole bunch of people leveled the town um and um i i lost a lot of friends during the storm um i mean im kind of im getting over it but its still its its still there and i think uh i i dont know i mean you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive in that but theres just theres nothing the only thing you can do is i is just think that that was like a freak accident and itll never happen again though laughter i live in la and you know laughter earthquakes laughter they could happen laughter and i just think oh id rather rather know that its coming than not know its coming yes laughter yeah sigh um mm depression its reoccurred multiple times thats no surprise um first time i was diagnosed was in middle school um which wouldve been sigh ten well twelve twel ten between ten twelve years ago i dont know xxx i dont know whenever i was in the sixth grade thats its when i first was told that i was depressed um as far as ptsd goes um post katrina um and then you know uh just post katrina mostly laughter that was the big thing um i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school it kinda wasnt i wasnt really seeking help its kind of i got i kinda got into my high school and they were like heres help cause we know youre gonna need it um and i was like oh well thanks i didnt really ask for it but okay ill take it um you know just kinda happened no not not anymore um eh sigh laughter thats a good question um laughter uh geez uh you know i really dont know i guess it just kinda stopped just kinda was like well im not gonna do this anymore uh sometimes sometimes its a lot of like how are you feeling today and stuff and you know its kind of well im feeling fine right now but ask me in two hours and who knows you know um sigh i guess it its helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen and to just get on and move along with your life um mm essentially just mm like carry on you know things will happen carry on sigh um wow laughter um uh i was um i was hanging out with my girlfriend just hanging out um well for starters i mean you y you cant see when i walked in but im walking with a cane right now cause i i got hit by a car recently and uh id id make my leg better um lets see canes over there that way but anyway um sigh i dont know uh make myself less fat laughter um id make it so i dont feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day um cause when you sleep like more than ten hours a day its just its unproductive you waste too much time like i have friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and im like how do you do that i have to sleep like twelve hours to feel good like you can sleep six you know like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four i have to get away with seven or eight you know like that thats my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours its just i dont know i oversleep but i like sleeping too i mean yeah its just the oversleeping part i dont like so much um sigh um utterly insane in a good way utterly insane in a good way um uh i guess like they they would also say like you know there the there are times where i might seem like an asshole and im im not really an asshole i just you know i i just have issues like everybody else um specifically i have uh aspergers so thats a form of autism um that just kinda makes life awesome theyd also say im flamboyant and eccentric cause i totally am i just i i dont know i figure im still alive so i should live because im still alive and you know who knows how long im gonna be alive for so i should you know live while im alive and just go out and do stuff and not not sit and be calm except when im reading and i like reading sigh um uh stop fucking up um no uh thats kinda messed up um i think i wouldve told myself at the time um cause ca cause i i ive known my my evil ex um ive known her since like i was like six and she was five i think ten years ago i wouldve grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl dont trust her she cant be trusted um and more importantly dont deep breath dont let your guard down around her cause shell shell exploit that and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally um yeah dont dont date her just dont do it its not worth it laughter its not worth the trouble its not worth the pain its not worth it sigh um the fact that im still alive maybe yeah uh i dont know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it um just i dont you know i dont really know i dont really use the term pride i dont really feel pride im just its its more of like the fact that im still alive im proud to be alive laughter i dont know if that makes me humble or just insane who knows do i press the button now oh bye okay
synch laughter yes im doing well i was born in oakland um sigh all the different areas of the city uh the different cultures that are here the traffic the um lack of public transportation and the superficiality laughter i i dont i would love to travel more um sigh being able to experience a different way of living um getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and getting a different perspective um in two thousand eight i studied abroad in brazil and that was about four months and i was in bahia which is in the north and um lets see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a homestay family um ive always wanted to travel and i chose brazil because um they have an afrobrazilian population or a large afrobrazilian population which i really wanted to learn more about and i think the history and the cullture is really interesting um i think taking a bus by myself to a remote beach and just navigating on my own and um figuring out where to go yeah right now im getting my masters in social work laughter dream job sigh i think to um consult about um mental health and how to um how to intervene effectively with different cultures and doing research and consulting work and getting to travel um basically that those would be the main characteristics i think thats a false dichotomy but i do consider myself shy but at the same time outgoing in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone and im determined to do what it takes to become successful laughter um i listen to music and just lay on my bed and um i guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things also breathing exercises which im learning more about um as well as exercise pretty good i dont get angry a lot um so as far as angry temperament im pretty good at that hmm um mm what month is this may probably two months ago and i argued via text message laughter so its not really intense arguing but i guess you could call it arguing in a sense over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor um with a friend ive had for a few years i felt anxious um sad and angry um yeah those are the main emotions i know them because i think im pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them and then ill notice the physical uh manifestations of emotions like if i if my hearts racing or if im getting sweaty if im sigh if my breathing is more shallow ill know im anxious ill know somethings bothering me hmm laughter that i wish i had handled differently i guess related to this argument um i went out one night and got a little too intoxicated and clears throat ended up calling a person for a ride home but that really upset that person and i know that it wasnt such a big deal but i wish i hadnt have let myself get to that point um it it impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did mm clears throat hardest decision sigh wow um probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards well after dropping out i had to really rethink what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on um sigh i think by recognizing what i dont want to do and doing a lot of research on program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program sigh mm sigh i have to think sigh oh laughter um revolving around the same person i spoke of earlier it was a dating relationship and a few years ago we had a falling out over his treatment of me and it involved another person and i wish i could get that out of my mind um laughter laughter i have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didnt grow up with her but ive gotten um closer to her as an adult uh we talk pretty regularly with my dad i grew up with him mostly he lives in atlanta and um we dont talk as much but we are we have a pretty decent relationship its not really that contentious or anything and im an only child so i dont have siblings i dont have a large family um so in general im not really that close to family um one person is my mentor who i met in two thousand five and shes a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things sigh pretty easy well its easy for me to sleep whats not easy is getting up because usually i do not forward f look forward to what i have to do that day and the thought of it is you know just makes me wanna stay in bed also i wake up pretty tired not really feeling refreshed clears throat i think just sigh selftalk about how what i have to do isnt that bad or that the things that im doing now are gonna end pretty soon with the end of the school year um trying to think of things that i can look forward to in the week um also listening to music and browsing the internet kinda gets my mind going sigh feeling sigh uh wow um feeling emotionally drained on some ways and at the same time feeling like ive accomplished a lot and that ive grown so a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of feeling accomplished and proud at the same time no i havent yes in two thousand six the convergence of a lot of stressful factors um i was out of touch with my mom i started um well i had transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous and just all those changes going on really um exacerbated  things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there and it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed yes i do yes i notice im better able to accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them im sigh able to think th think differently about things that happened maybe look at things in a more positive light and also identify the areas i need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas clears throat mm sigh um this past weekend i reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again laughter um sigh people have different takes on on me i dont have one best friend but i think people would describe me as very um analytical sensitive intelligent intellectual um i wish that i did not or wait i wish i was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which im working on and sigh i wish that i had more energy laughter start going to therapy now laughter um but yeah i really would and also to what how old am i twenty eight ten years ago eighteen okay so graduating from high school i would sigh tell myself to pick up some more job skills so that i wouldnt have to struggle as much in the future and to seek out mentors to get

synch yes im feel great i am from saint louis missouri born and raised yes ive been here a couple times i just recently moved back two months ago saint louis is quite slower uh to take care of a good friend that who whos ill thank you i jumped right back on the bandwagon the climate and the restaurants the dirt and the traffic yes i do uh the road maps following a road map maybe driving myself well we just recently got back from uh colorado went up into the mountains saw the the snow and enjoyed a little fine dining in colorado uh actually going um horseback riding through the royal gorge yes it was i would be more outgoing im a people person laughter i listen to jazz music and i also draw ive probably mastered controlling my temper through age mm it wouldve been my husband and it was about financial issues unsure un unsure unstable i dont like loud talking or mm loud emotion i like to sit and methodically and logically talk about things not raise my voice hmm most recently with the illness of my friend i wish i wouldve handled his sister a little differently as far as things that shes wanted me to do that i really needed to tell her otherwise the way they really needed to be done i took her advice where i shouldnt of um we he i was engaged to him fifteen years ago and he recently called me i guess about five years ago and told me he was diagnosed with cancer weve always maintained our friendship and i asked my husband if i could go help him in his time of need and im here it has been um a lot of things one hes a good friend of mine and his sister moved out here as well two my son wanted to start his career out here three i love the weather and thats all i can think of at the moment laughter mhm uh it would be the the death of my youngest son i dont know where to start as far as he was born premature and since he was born so early i had him in five months versus nine the we we made the decision to take him off life support cause he wasnt getting any better so that wouldve been the the hardest decision i made with my husband mhm um i really dont wanna erase anything from my memory ive actually um learn and experience and gain knowledge from from things that happen so im not ss im not one to put things erase things out of my mind i categorize them and place them in memories uh its very close lost my mother at a young age and uh all of us siblings and my father still remain very close mm my father oh hes very health conscious very energetic and exercises e uh exercises and has a spirituality about him that uh i want to have as well its a contentment that he that he portrays that i that i would like to have as well no problem very confused or um skittish i guess would be the word lately fine f fine except for the fact that my um good friend who im helping take care of we just got out of the hospital so its been a little hectic the last two days um no not lately no i have not no i have not um i was excited um with good friends in good company i should say and um i had just got back from a concert so it was outside it was enjoyable music i was with good friends we ate well and enjoyed the moment uh as a giving spiritual normal person i dont know laughter um i cant think of anything that id wanna change except for maybe exercise a little more i i cant recall one off hand no to have save more money and to not try and accomplish everything at once i started out in cosmetology then i went into um college have some college in mathematics and finance traveling mm i had a lot lo i like to i enjoy um good food nice wine and company i just went last night to a very nice italian restaurant and was in the company of good friends and family and we dined and talked and that was fun most proud of i guess it would be my children youre welcome bye bye
synch yes im fine thank you detroit michigan yes i moved to la myself in two thousand and seven but my family came here many more years ago more like forty years ago uh i dont go back to detroit anymore i really dont like the weather and i really dont have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here in california and uh completely different um for me detroit was just very cold it it wasnt the best for my personality i prefer la more open space a warmer climate warmer people just a different different uh vibe that i that i like better after my husband and i relationship ended i had family out here so i thought it would be easier to start over here than some of the other places i had lived or to stay where we were at extremely easy i came out here every year to visit while i was in college so i was extremely used to it plus i had also taken um six months out of off of school and lived out here and went to school out here so i was completely used to it well like i said the weather is number one its just uh less crowded its more open space its a a calmer friendlier vibe less rushed the smog would be one and when i drive the traffic in certain areas it can be but um in general theres not a lot that i dont like l its like i guess the overall threat of earthquake but thats isnt really that much of a factor cause it rarely happens the price of real estate laughter thats another one that i dont necessarily like i cant see your shoes i cant see your shoes at all so i dont travel as much as i used to but i have traveled worldwide new experiences well i used to be an international flight attendant and then later i traveled through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so ive traveled a lot of different places and um ill have to say they were all pretty much enjoyable cause you know theres different cultures different things to see do learn enjoy experience uh my experiences i would say in um europe visiting moreso ive also visited uh in south south america i guess cause the cultures are so very different i would probably say more shy um in general um compared to people who i know are really really outgoing although ive had them describe me as outgoing i like to read i like to walk or power walk or hike listen to music you know im very good at controlling my temper oh probably when i was married with my husband many years ago it it could be many things i dont even know in specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate slash argument with him it could be it could be a choice of uh some of the instances when i mightve been with him and i you know got emotional or let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than um just you know seen it as not something to respond to perhaps but it would always be were we were also pushed to answer so you know you cant always just say ignore a person there cause many times its just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesnt escalate but some people you know dont respond to the socalled norm if you ignore it mm uh theyll just you know deescalate but thats not always the case i taught middle school kids and you can try calm um methods with them but that doesnt always work but you always have to as the teacher maintain you know your professional demeanor so you cant really um even when they you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or other kids so well that could be several mm um i guess a decision in um along with my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery uh that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way and in that case she died so you know uh its a pretty hard decision cause you dont know but you also know if you dont that it could be very serious outcome for them as well mhm sigh oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second guessing things that you might could do but they also can be learning experiences so is it necessarily a good thing to erase them you know if you can look at it as positive sometimes people can have a strong reaction and they dont really look past the uh impact of the event cause there might be something that you can gain from that but there are i i grew up in a home of dysfunction so there was just domestic abuse you know and um there were many incidences so you cant just say only one cause there is lots of traumatic things but it also wouldve been a different outcome in say learning to deal with some of the things that occur in life as an adult that sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends that have not had really strong experiences fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so um you can listen you know you and i and i cause i understand that not everybodys had the same experience you know you can walk them through levels of understanding and you know as you know someone you have a balance of background information on which to help them pull from and to see that you know things will progress in a better way knowing that this isnt like the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be and you can also relate other experiences to them of things that were worse or you know seem to be and of course theres always in general i mean when you look at all the calamities in the world you know most of those things arent affecting us or the people that we know here so that provides us perspective that you know can pull someone out of their i wont necessarily say selfabsorption but the seemingly intensity of their experience right at the moment well we have a a good relationship they eh for the most part there are different levels of um stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it has made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others some have not had um as much experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way so its always evolving and i walk in positivity as a a lead of you know uh the way i respond to uh try and engender a more positive response from them rather than feed sometimes the um very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have pardon i didnt di i didnt hear you could you repeat hmm hmm my mother different teachers friends well my mother has always been a very calm um person for the most part easygoing even though shes experienced a lot of negativity ive had teachers that have um been very um positive po positive and proactive and have you know taught independent thinking and techniques to rise above some of the things that were occurring and just various friends that you know i would see handling situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so it depends for the most part its you know pretty good um it depends if im dealing with a lot of things or studying or you know um trying to get more hours in the day cause i need to get things done then you know its less but um in general i dont have a problem sleeping its just if i make myself stay awake aw stay up because theres more stuff that i wanna get done ive been feeling okay uh less you know stressful in xxx it it goes in general cause im got several projects that im working on so um but in general good like i mean not in particular i mean i just seems um less stressful as i get more stuff done i just and the stress comes from sometimes there being a lot more things to do in a shorter period of time but you know reorganizing some of the things that need to be done you know can smoothe that out no i havent but i know its something that a lot of uh say veterans in particular have people have i have not no well theres several i guess um and happiness comes in small or large things but in general every day d every day every every moment to me is i mean mea i mean every day every morning is great wonderful you know day of happiness um as far as big celebratory kinds of things i dont have big highs and lows like that i think its something that should be on your continuum you know in every day it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be you know a moment shared with someone you know so it should be an even on an even keel um as uh uh perseverant um you know i will continue forth and and um positive upbeat um maybe not doing things differently when i were younger like spending my money differently or or spending my time you know a little more differently but thats hard to say its like okay as your get older you can see you know you couldve done some things differently instead of buying the house that i did i wouldve you know waited and bought another one i mean things like that i would have um made myself move to california sooner and im i would have um instead of buying the house that i bought then if id know i would ss would have you know the situation i have now waited to get something different but you know how can you you know have that hindsight you make the best decision that you can at the time with the best information in information available you know after you have looked at several options of um being independent and educated able to uh take care of myself okay bye bye now
synch yes fine oh san fernando valley uh well i really like the culture i love going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around its spread out a lot and its a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and not have a good public transportation system uh not really i like to go camping but i dont really travel um i think sigh it mightve been around six months ago i went on a trip with a geology class yeah it was fun hmm sigh i think its tough to say um well i think the first time i went camping was probably really memorable i went to death valley and i got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night philosophy yes um hmm i dont know i think it just sort of happened i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of grew disillusioned with that and i liked all the different ways or all the different things i could do with philosophy huh i dont know but i really like children and i really like studying their behavior so i think something along those lines might be it i think im generally pretty outgoing i tend to be shy around my family but when im around friends and stuff i i think im pretty friendly um a lot of times ill watch tv or read um yeah i think im pretty good i dont really get mad i try to think about other things if i start getting mad or um i just start trying to focus on my breathing i think the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my boyfriend um but im having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was um i think it was wa i wasnt feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his departments end of year party and he was getting frustrated which i thought was very inconsiderate cause i wasnt feeling well to begin with well i felt like he wasnt really taking my feelings into consideration and i really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because i just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out hmm i think a lot of times when my oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother uh does something wrong i tend to be harsh with him um were not as close as my sister and i or my youngest brother and i and so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were a little bit more gentle it might be easier to communicate with him hmm um when i was nineteen i came home from a party i think around four am on a sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me said a lot of not very nice things and then he didnt speak to me for about a year uh well my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that i dont live at home um i used to be really frustrated with her all the time cause she has a really quick temper but i think now that ive got a little bit more distance i can see that she did the best that she could um sigh and i love my siblings i again my little sister and i get along really well shes four years younger than me and when when she was around twelve and i was around sixteen it was really difficult cause she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody and i wasnt in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we dont anymore and thats really great and we get along okay with my uh my older little brother whos fifteen and i think i get along pretty well with my youngest brother whos twelve scrubbedentry one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved her classes and it was really good uh being in a class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that i think its pretty easy i mean sometimes ill have trouble going to sleep but generally its not that bad its i think its usually harder for me to wake up in the morning um well im really tired i can get grumpy but i think usually im just groggy pretty good im a little anxious about um about getting a job and im gonna be taking summer school about its only one class so ill have a lot of free time um yeah sigh well i mean its not the end of the world if i dont get a job but i know that i will eventually so mostly i think i just try not to think about it too much and i try not to be pessimistic no no hmm well i think the last time i felt really happy i went to a party with my boyfriend the end of department party and um i was the you know i knew a couple people there so i felt comfortable but i was also able to meet new people and there were a couple kids there splashing around in the pool and i had a couple drinks and ate some food and it was fun um she would probably say that im smart and uh pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch really like serious films and tv um and she would probably also say that im fun cause we like to go out and have fun a lot well im kinda ki i can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes so um so thats a major one that and procrastinating hmm um i got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was uh uh given eh sixty some hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing that so i had to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was very mean and he didnt seem i mean he yelled at me but it didnt seem like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just sort of a stock speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so i understand cause thats his job but it was was not great for me cause i wasnt i i was really anxious in that situation well i wouldve been twelve and two um but i think i think i wouldve told myself at twelve not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents cause i think i was a little selfish and selfinvolved back then i cant really think of anything i mean i regret how i treated my mother when i was a kid but everyone does that and um i do regret a couple of semesters ago i didnt do so well in school and i got a a few ws which i now have to work to get off on my transcript i think so im i think i i wasnt focusing in school at that time and i didnt see any counselors at school or anything so i definitely couldve done that hmm i think id probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping in saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges and then maybe going out to breakfast sunday and just like window shopping and maybe watching a little bit of tv huh well my youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up im ten years older than him so and being the oldest i always i always took care of him which made me really really patient because he was a handful but im really proud of how he turned out and um and how close we are

thirty twenty yes laughter so um now she doesnt know that i realize you know that part of it so um there was a little bit of a argument and uh but again not a argument but a disagreement and when we

dont that doesnt that sound good laughter yeah well a little attacked you know so it depends on im very good at controlling my temper its uh you know there are places where you can allow your temper to come out even though it might not be appropriate and then there are other places where if it comes out then you shot yourself in the foot so uh im pretty good at controlling my temper yeah um i dont have any situation recent that i can think of um probably say um just dealing with a neighbor uh instead of uh uh responding to the neighbor just ignore the neighbor altogether so i wish i had done that differently yeah hmm thankfully ive not had to make that type of decision in my life as yet mhm hmm um mm i have um what i do in my life and and you know in my going forward you know um everything that ive done and everything that has happened i accept it as something that has to be to get me to go forward uh i am a born again christian and so i know that that god is sovereign over my life uh and also that according to his word the bible says that every day of our life is written in his book so events and circumstances um i feel that i feel they are ordained by god now obviously im not going to um jump into a burning fire or do anything ridiculous but um i feel that things that had happened hap that have happened even if ive dealt with them the wrong way uh its gods sovereignty s his total sovereignty has control over that and it will work for my good so thats how i feel um i have all brothers and so im not really that close with my brothers and my mother say that again um people that ive grown up with um neighbors from when ive uh when i was younger uh that i was close to um uh different friends uh that ive had along the way uh friends who are more like family so yeah theyve had positive influence thats i get i sleep too well laughter so i sleep well every night so normal but i my normal ive been feeling my normal no no no um that was recent something happened um i was um able to participate um with um my church on sunday with wi i was a pentecost it was pentecost sunday meaning it was fifty days after the resurrection of jesus christ and

difficulties very well um and that i dress well laughter laughter um i dont wanna change anything i do want to just be a better me so be a better person uh so um i am working on uh listening better uh communicating better uh and and uh accepting my uh weaknesses better as well as my strengths no mm thats a good question i would have uh i wouldve told myself to to uh do what i know to do to do what i know uh that which is right and um ooh xxx uh to do what i know is right and uh let everything else let the other chips fall where they may but to do what i know to do is right and to go forward um
